Nazik gave Batman a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.

Initially, Batman is in a vertex $s$ and his power is equal to $p$. During each of the next $M$ seconds, the following process happens:
- A robber with power $r$ runs from a vertex $x$ straight to vertex $y$.
- Batman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).
- Batman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.
- Let's denote Batman's current vertex by $s$ ($s=s_i$ initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex $g$ such that each vertex on the simple path between $x$ and $y$ (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between $s$ and $g$ (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex $g$ so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.
- If Batman catches the robber, $g$ becomes his current vertex.
- After Batman catches this robber, his power increases by $t$.

Your task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after $M$ seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $s_i$ and $p$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge in the tree between vertices $u$ and $v$.
- The next line contains a single integer $M$.
- Each of the following $M$ lines contains four integers $x$, $y$, $r$ and $t$ describing a robber.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum possible value of Batman's power after $M$ seconds.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N, M \le 4\cdot10^5$
- $1 \le s_i, u, v \le N$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- $1 \le x, y \le N$
- $x \neq y$
- $1 \le p, r \le 10^9$
- $|t| \le 10^9$
- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $4\cdot10^5$
- the sum of $M$ for all test cases does not exceed $4\cdot10^5$

### Example Input
```
1
6 1 4
1 2
2 3
2 4
4 5
1 6
5
6 4 3 8
1 2 3 2
4 6 5 -1
6 5 4 6
5 4 5 -3
```

### Example Output
```
12
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- In the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex $s=1$ to vertex $g=5$.
- In the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex $s=5$ to vertex $g=6$.
- Batman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.
