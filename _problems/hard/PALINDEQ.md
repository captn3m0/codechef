For two strings $A$ and $B$ with the same length $N$, we will say that they are *equivalent* if the following rule holds: For each pair of integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le N$), the substring of $A$ between the $l$-th and $r$-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome if and only if the substring of $B$ between the $l$-th and $r$-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome.

You are given a string $S$ with length $N$. Find the number of sets $P \subset \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ such that there is a character $c$ and a string $X$ which is equivalent to $S$ and satisfies $X_p = c$ for each $p \in P$. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of subsets of characters that can be equal to each other in some string equivalent to $S$, modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 2,000$
- $S$ contains only lowercase Latin letters

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $N \le 10$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** $T \le 10$

### Example Input
```
2
aaa
aba
```

### Example Output
```
8
5
```
