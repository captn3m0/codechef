All submissions for this problem are available.There are **nm** men living in a town. They have **nh** horses, each capable of carrying only one man at a time. All the men are supposed to attend a dinner party **d** km away from their house. They should start their journey together and reach destination in minimum time. Speed of each man is **vm** km/hour whereas speed of each horse (with or without somebody on back) is **vh** km/hour. You need to find the minimum time required to complete the journey? For simplicity you can assume the following things:

- No time is needed in riding a horse or getting down from a horse.
- The horses are very well trained to execute any instruction given to it.
- No time is needed for changing the direction of horse or man.
- The town and the dinner party location can be considered as two different points and all people and horses travel along the straight line connecting these two points.

### Constraints

- d (0 &lt; d ≤ 10000)
- nm (1 &lt; nm ≤ 1000)
- nh (0 &lt; nh ≤ 1000)
- vm (0 &lt; vm ≤ 20)
- vh (0 &lt; vh ≤ 50)

### Input

Each input set consists of five integers **d, nm, nh, vm, vh** in a new line. Input ends with five 0s in a line. There will be at max **105+1** lines in the input

### Output

For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line should print a fraction **p** by **q**, in **p/q** form. This denotes the minimum possible reaching time of all men. Here **p** and **q** must be relative prime.
