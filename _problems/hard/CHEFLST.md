Once upon a time, in a land far, far away... nevermind, we don't recall the rest of the story.

All we know is that Chef has a matrix of integers $M$ with $N$ rows and $N$ columns; he wants to take a single element from each row and a single element from each column ($N$ elements in total) and find their [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR). Find the set of all values he could obtain.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. 
- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of the following lines contains $N$ space-separated integers $M_{i, 1}, M_{i, 2}, \dots, M_{i, N}$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one or more space-separated integers in increasing order â€” the obtainable values.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 7$
- $1 \le N \le 60$
- $0 \le M_{i, j} \le 1,023$ for each valid $i, j$

### Subtasks
**Subtaks #1 (5 points):** $1 \le N \le 10$

**Subtask #2 (20 points):** $1 \le N \le 14$

**Subtaks #3 (5 points):** $0 \le M_{i, j} \le 1$ for each valid $i, j$

**Subtask #4 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3
5 9 15
19 7 2
1 0 0
```

### Example Output
```
2 7 9 10 26 28
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We could choose $M_{1, 1} = 5$ and $M_{2, 2} = 7$; since we are only allowed to choose one element from each row and one from each column, we cannot choose anything else from rows 1, 2 and columns 1, 2, so we have to choose $M_{3, 3} = 0$. Their XOR is $5 \oplus 7 \oplus 0 = 2$.

Another combination could be $M_{1, 3} = 15$, $M_{2, 1} = 19$ and $M_{3, 2} = 0$. Their XOR is $15 \oplus 19 \oplus 0 = 28$.
