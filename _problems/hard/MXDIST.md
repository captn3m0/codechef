<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/hindi/MXDIST.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/bengali/MXDIST.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/mandarin/MXDIST.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/russian/MXDIST.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/vietnamese/MXDIST.pdf) as well.

You are given $N$ points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_N, y_N)$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given a range $[f, t]$. Consider the points $(x_f, y_f), (x_{f+1}, y_{f+1}), \ldots, (x_t, y_t)$; the answer to a query is the square of the maximum Euclidean distance between any two of these points.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $f$ and $t$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the squared maximum distance.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N, Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le f \le t \le N$
- $0 \le x_i, y_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 3,000$, **TL=1.5s**

**Subtask #2 (35 points):** the coordinates of all points are chosen uniformly randomly, **TL=5s**

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints, **TL=5s**
