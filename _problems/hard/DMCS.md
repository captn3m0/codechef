<p>Dai Ma Chu Shi is a Chinese CodeChef.</p>
<p>He recently got a huge chocolate with the size <b>2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × n</b>. (Yes, in five-dimensional space).<br />
He wants to cut it into <b>8n</b> pieces of small chocolate of size <b>1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2</b> each. Please notice that the direction doesn't matter, <b>1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 1</b> and <b>2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 </b> are acceptable.
</p>
<p>He wants to know how many ways he can achieve this feat in. Because the answer is very large, please tell him the answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contain a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> tests follow. Each test case contain a single integer <b>n</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the problem modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>1000</b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>n</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>
<li><b>Subtask 1 (30 points)</b>, <b>n</b> is a power of <b>2</b>.</li>
<li><b>Subtask 2 (70 points)</b>, Original constraints</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
1
1

<b>Output:</b>
272
</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>I have discovered a truly marvellous enumeration of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.</p>
