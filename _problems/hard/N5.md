<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Little Johnny has a selection of boxes. Each box has a number on its side. The boxes are placed in a sequence, and Johnny wants to sort them (in ascending order). He has a device to manipulate the boxes, which performs the following operation. Johnny can select a subset of boxes, and the machine will lift the selected subset, shift the selected subset to the right (keeping the order in the subset), shift the not-selected subset to the left, filling up empty spaces (keeping the order in the subset), then finally move the raised boxes to be in one level again.</p>
<p>For example: if Johnny has the sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,6, and selects the subset in bold: 1,2,<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong>,5,<strong>6</strong>, then the result is: 1,2,5,<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong>,<strong>6</strong>.</p>
<p>Help Johnny to write a program that will calculate the minimal number of moves required to sort the given sequence of boxes in ascending order of numbers.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First, 1   t   10, the number of test cases. Then, t testcases follow. Each starts with 1   n   10<sup>5</sup>, the number of boxes. Then, n integer values describing the sizes of boxes in the sequence.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase, in a separate line, print the answer to that testcase.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
1<br />6 1 3 5 2 4 6<br /><strong>Output:</strong>
2</pre>
