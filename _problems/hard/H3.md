<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>After learning about congruent triangles in his recent mathematics lesson, Johnny has become very excited. He has even invented an interesting counting problem involving congruent triangles!</p>
<p>Recall that two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal in length and their corresponding angles are equal in size. A lattice triangle is a triangle such that the coordinates of all its vertices are integers. Johnny's problem can now be described as follows:</p>
<p>You are given an integer M and a lattice triangle ABC all of whose vertices (A, B, and C) are inside rectangle R<sub>M</sub>. R<sub>M</sub> is the rectangle having (0,0) as its bottom-left corner and (M,M) as its top-right corner. In other words, 0 ≤     x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub> ≤ M. The problem is to count the number of lattice triangles congruent to ABC also having all their vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M</sub>.</p>
<p>Could you help Johnny write a program to solve this problem?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line contains two numbers M and K (1≤     M ≤    1000, 1≤     K     ≤1000). K is the number of given triangles.</li>
<li>Each line in the next K lines contains 6 integers x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub> (0 ≤    x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub>≤     M) describing a triangle ABC. It is guaranteed that ABC is always a triangle (i.e., non-degenerate).</li>
</ul>
<p>The input for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the string "Case #T:" where T should be replaced by the corresponding test case number.</p>
<p>Then, K lines should follow, each line containing the number of triangles having vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M</sub>, congruent to the corresponding triangle given in the input.</p>
<p>Print a blank line after each test case.</p>
