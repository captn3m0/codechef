For a given positive integers **B** and **X** find the number of positive integers **N** such that number **N\*X** has at least one divisor **D** such that **N < D <= B**.

### Input

 The first line contains a single positive integer **T <= 40**, the number of test cases. **T** test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two positive integers **B <= 1012** and **X <= 60**.

### Output

 For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

### Example
