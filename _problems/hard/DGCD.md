All submissions for this problem are available.You're given a [tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29) on **N** vertices. Each vertex has a positive integer written on it, number on the ith vertex being **vi**. Your program must process two types of queries :

1\. Find query represented by **F u v** : Find out [gcd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of all numbers on the unique path between vertices **u** and **v** in the tree (both inclusive). 2. Change query represented by **C u v d** : Add **d** to the number written on all vertices along the unique path between vertices **u** and **v** in the tree (both inclusive).

### Input

First line of input contains an integer **N** denoting the size of the vertex set of the tree. Then follow **N - 1** lines, ith of which contains two integers **ai** and **bi** denoting an edge between vertices **ai** and **bi** in the tree. After this follow **N** space separated integers in a single line denoting initial values **vi** at each of these nodes. Then follows a single integer **Q** on a line by itself, denoting the number of queries to follow. Then follow **Q** queries, each one on a line by itself. Each query is either a find query or a change query with format as given in problem statement. Note that all vertices are 0-based.

### Output

For every find query, print the answer to that query in one line by itself. ### Example
