What makes the Chef impressed the most is the road system of the country. Byteland has <b>N<\/b> cities numbered 1 through <b>N<\/b>. City 1 is the capital of Byteland. The country also has <b>N<\/b>-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The <b>i<\/b>-th road connects two different cities <b>u<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>v<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. In this road system, people can travel between every pair of different cities by going through exactly one path of roads.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe roads are arranged in such a way that people can distinguish two cities only when both cities have different number of roads connected to it. Such two cities will be considered <i>similar<\/i>. For example, city <b>A<\/b> is similar to the capital if the number of roads connected to city <b>A<\/b> is equal to the number of roads connected to the capital.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOn each day during the vacation, the Chef wants to have a trip as follows. He chooses two cities <b>A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b> such that the Chef will visit city <b>B<\/b> if he goes from <b>A<\/b> to the capital using the shortest path. Then, the Chef will visit the cities on the shortest path from <b>A<\/b> to <b>B<\/b> through this path. Please note that <b>A<\/b> may be equal to <b>B<\/b>; that means the Chef will enjoy the day in a single city.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Chef does not want to have <i>similar<\/i> trips. Two trips are considered <i>similar<\/i> if and only if<br \/>\nthey both have the same number of visited cities and for each <b>i<\/b>, the <b>i<\/b>-th city visited in one trip is <i>similar<\/i> to the <b>i<\/b>-th city visited in the other trip.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Chef wants to have as many different, namely not <i>similar<\/i>, trips as possible. Help him count the maximum number of possible trips such that no two of them are similar.<\/p>\n<p><h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N<\/b>. The <b>i<\/b>-th line of next <b>N<\/b>-1 lines contains two space-separated integers <b>u<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>v<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, denoting the <b>i<\/b>-th road.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nOutput a single line containing the maximum number of different trips.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p>\n1 \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 100000 (10<sup>5<\/sup>)<br \/><b>u<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> \u2260 <b>v<sub>i<\/sub><\/b><br \/><br \/>\nEvery pair of different cities can be traveled by going through exactly one path of roads.<\/p>\n<h3>Sample<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>:\n3\n2 1\n3 1\n\n<b>Output<\/b>:\n3\n<\/pre><h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>\nIn the sample, the country consists of three cities.<br \/>\nThere are two roads.
