The Euler totient function $\varphi(N)$ is defined as the number of integers between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive) which are coprime with $N$.

You are given $N$ and $\varphi(N)$. Calculate the prime factorization of $N$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $\varphi(N)$.

### Output
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer $K$ â€” the number of distinct prime factors of $N$. Then, print $K$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers $p_i$ and $e_i$ denoting a prime divisor of $N$ and its exponent. Specifically, the following conditions should hold:
- $N = \prod_{i=1}^{K} p_i^{e_i}$
- $p_i \lt p_{i+1}$ for each valid $i$
- $e_i \gt 0$ for each valid $i$

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $2 \le N \le 10^{500}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (5 points):** $2 \le N \le 10^{14}$

**Subtask #2 (25 points):** $2 \le N \le 10^{50}$

**Subtask #3 (70 points):** $2 \le N \le 10^{500}$

### Example Input
