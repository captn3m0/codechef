<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Genetic engineering is fun. The scientists have gathered several DNAs and want to create something new out of those. Each DNAs can be represented as a sequence of bases A, G, T, C. Let DNA[a..b] be the subsequence of DNA starting from index a finishing in b inclusive, and DNA[a..] be the subsequence of DNA starting from index a to the end. Scientist can perform the following operations on the DNAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>cross operation     they take DNA1 and DNA2 and numbers k1 and k2. Then two new DNAs are created: DNA3 = DNA1[1..k1]+DNA2[k2+1..] and DNA4 = DNA2[1..k2]+DNA1[k1+1..].</li>
<li>mutate operation     they take a DNA, number k and one of the bases. Then they replace the base in position k in DNA with that base.</li>
<li>also they need to know certain characteristics of those DNAs. So they can perform count operation     they take DNA and numbers k1 and k2 (k1 &lt;= k2). This operation should return the number of A, G, T, C bases in DNA[k1..k2].</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The initial DNAs are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the amount of those DNAs. The new DNAs created in the cross operations are numbered with consecutive integers. You are to write a program to help scientists perform those operations.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input file contains number n     the amount of initial DNAs. Each of the following n lines contains the description of each DNA. The next line contains number q     the amount of operations to perform. The next q lines contain the description of each operation in the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li>CROSS id1 id2 k1 k2</li>
<li>MUTATE id k m</li>
<li>COUNT id k1 k2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20<br /> 1 &lt;= q &lt;= 30000<br /> The length of each initial DNA does not exceed 30000. The length of any DNA formed in cross operation won   t exceed 2000000000. Total amount of different DNAs won   t exceed 10000. It is guaranteed that all operations are correct.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each count operation print four integers: the number of each of the bases in the given subsequence of the given DNA.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
