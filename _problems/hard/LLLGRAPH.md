### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/hindi/LLLGRAPH.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/bengali/LLLGRAPH.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/mandarin/LLLGRAPH.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/russian/LLLGRAPH.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/vietnamese/LLLGRAPH.pdf) as well.

Consider an undirected graph $G$ with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges. A *line graph* $L(G)$ of this graph is a graph with $M$ vertices; each of these vertices corresponds to an edge in $G$ and two vertices in $L(G)$ are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in $G$ have a common vertex.

Let $L^k(G)$ denote the result of performing the operation "replace $G$ by $L(G)$" $k$ times, i.e. $L^1(G) = L(G)$, $L^2(G) = L(L(G))$, $L^3(G)=L(L(L(G)))$ and so on.

You are given an undirected simple graph $G$ with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ edges, and a positive integer $K$. Find the size of the largest independent set in $L^K(G)$. Since this value may be very large, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$.
- Each of the next $M$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of vertices in the largest independent set in $L^K(G)$, modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $2 \le N, M \le 2,000$
- $1 \le K \le 7$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- $G$ does not contain any self-loops or parallel edges

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $K = 1$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input

```
4 6 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
2 4
3 4
```

### Example Output
```
3
```
