Chef is tired of solving boring math problems by hand. One of these problems is summing up the products of elements from each **k**-subset of the set **\[n\]**. Here, a **k**-subset is a subset containing exactly **k** elements and **\[n\]** refers to the set which contains all integers between **1** and **n** (inclusive). More formally:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lucas110550/ProblemImages/master/lucasth.png)Let’s denote this number by **f**(**n**, **k**). Note that **f**(**n**, 0) = 1.

Since calculating **f(n, k)** is too boring, Chef wants to know how the divisibility of **f(n, k)** by a given prime **p** depends on **k**. Specifically, for a fixed **n**, you should compute the number of ways to select **k** (0 ≤ **k** ≤ **n**) so that **f**(**n**, **k**) isn't divisible by **p**. After a while of thinking, Chef realized there might be too many ways to do that. Therefore, you should compute this number modulo **109+7**.

### Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers **n** and **p**.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one number — the number of ways to select **k**, modulo 109+7.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 4
- 1 ≤ **n** &lt; 10501
- **n** does not contain leading zeroes
- 2 ≤ **p** ≤ 100,000
- **p** is prime

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (10 points):** **n** ≤ 5,000

**Subtask #2 (40 points):** **n** ≤ 100,000

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>

1
4 2

<b>Output:</b>

2
</pre>
### Explanation

**Example case 1:** The values of **f**(4, **k**) are as follows:

- **f**(4, 0) = 1
- **f**(4, 1) = 1+2+3+4 = 10
- **f**(4, 2) = 1·2+2·3+3·4+4·1+1·3+2·4 = 35
- **f**(4, 3) = 1·2·3+2·3·4+1·3·4+1·2·4 = 50
- **f**(4, 4) = 1·2·3·4 = 24

Only **k** = 0 and **k** = 2 give numbers indivisible by **p** = 2, so the answer is 2.
