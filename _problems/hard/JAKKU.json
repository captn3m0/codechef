now there are <b>N<\/b> satellites orbiting Earth.\nEach satellite has sensors to detect black money transaction on the visible half of the planet.\nFor example, when a satellite is passing over north pole, it's sensors can detect any transaction in the northern hemisphere.\nThis surveillance has become a real pain point for some businessmen, as the satellite sensors are really good.\nA powerful businessman wants to conduct a big black money transaction somewhere on the planet surface.\nTo do this, he must first sabotage all satellites which would be able to detect the transaction.\nThe businessman can choose any place and time for the transaction, as long as it is on the planet surface.\nPlease help him by finding the minimum number of satellites that must be sabotaged so that the transaction goes undetected.\nHe has promised you a small fraction of the money (in old currency) as a reward for your services.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n&lt;object

orbits along longitude <b>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, and at time t=0, is in phase <b>p<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.\nPhase of an orbiting body is <i>the angle between north pole, planet center and the orbiting body<\/i>.\nIf phase <b>p<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> is less than 180 degree, the body lies on longitude <b>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> somewhere between north pole and south pole.\nIf phase is more than 180 degree, the body lies on longitude <b>l<sub>i<\/sub>-180<\/b> somewhere between south pole and north pole.\n\n<p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Extra Explanation:<\/b> Note that the formulation of longitude and phase is slightly different from the system of longitudes and latitudes we use to denote points on earth's surface.\nIt is closer to Spherical coordinate system, but we have constrained the azimuth angle (<b>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> in the figure above) to be between 0 and 180, so the azimuth angle of an orbiting satellite does not change, and polar angle can be anywhere between 0 and 360.\nAt time <b>t<\/b>, the <b>i<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> satellite is located at <b>x = sin(p<sub>i<\/sub> + t) * cos(l<sub>i<\/sub>), y = sin(p<sub>i<\/sub> + t) * sin(l<sub>i<\/sub>), z = cos(p<sub>i<\/sub> + t)<\/b>.\n\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Assumptions to be made:<\/b>\n<ul>\n<li>The transaction takes place on a place which has arbitrarily small(but non zero) area.<\/li>\n<li>The transaction lasts for arbitrarily short(but non zero) duration.<\/li>\n<li>All satellites have circular orbit which is very far away from the planet\u2019s surface.\n<\/li>\n<li>All satellites orbit at the same distance and the same speed.\n<\/li>\n<li>All angles are in degrees.\n<\/li>\n<li>The geometric center of the Planet is same as its center of mass.\n<\/li>\n<li>No special or general relativistic effects.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of <b>T<\/b> test cases

<b>p<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of satellites that must be sabotaged to conduct

them, so he does not need to sabotage any of them.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Example case 2<\/b>: The businessman can do transaction at time t=160 (after all satellites have complete 160 degrees of rotation), at longitude 125, and phi 267 (55W, 3S).\nNo satellite has to be sabotaged in this case either.\n<\/p>\n","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2,
