The exact position of this point is not important, since you are given the position of each ring explicitly, and there is nothing special about the positions of the rings relative to this point \u2015 it is only guaranteed that the point lies on the border of each ring. Then, Dr.D starts throwing darts at the rings. To make the game highly challenging, Dr.D considers a throw *successful* only if it lands inside or on the border of **all the rings**.\r\n\r\nSince Dr.D is beyond awesome, he sometimes feels like the game is not challenging enough, so he pins another ring to the wall at the same point with the same nail. All the rules described above still apply \u2015 the position of the new ring relative to the chosen points is arbitrary, there is one more dart ring on the wall and a throw is successful only if it lands inside or on the border of all the rings.\r\n\r\nYou should process $Q$ queries of two types:\r\n- `1 X Y C`: Dr.D adds a ring. The center of this ring is the point $(X, Y)$ and its radius is $R = \\sqrt{C}$.\r\n- `2 X Y`: Dr.D throws a dart at the point $(X, Y)$.\r\n\r\nNote that the queries are encoded so that you have to process them online.
