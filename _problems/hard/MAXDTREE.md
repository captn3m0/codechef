You have a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$) rooted at vertex $1$. Each vertex contains a decimal digit; let's denote the digit in vertex $i$ by $d_i$.

A subtree is a non-empty subgraph satisfying the following condition: for any vertex $v$, if $v$ belongs to subtree $S$, then the parent of $v$ also belongs to $S$. Note that each subtree contains the root. The vertices in any subtree $S$ are sorted in DFS-order, i.e. using the following algorithm:
- let's denote a *current vertex* by $c$; initially, the current vertex is the root
- when processing vertex $c$:
    - $c$ is the next vertex in DFS-order
    - consider all sons of $c$ which belong to $S$, sorted in increasing order
    - for each of these sons, change the current vertex $c$ to that son and process it recursively

For any subtree $S$ with $k$ vertices, we define the *digit string* $D(S)$ as a string with length $k$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is the digit in the $i$-th vertex of $S$ (in DFS-order). $D(S)$ may also be considered an integer in decimal representation.

Let's define $\mathrm{maxDigit}(x)$ as the largest decimal digit in a positive integer $x$. Consider the following infinite recurrent sequence $a$:
- $a_1 = 1$
- $a_n = a_{n-1} + \mathrm{maxDigit}(a_{n-1})$ for each $n \gt 1$

For example, the first few members of this sequence are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 22$.

Next, let's call a subtree $S$ *good* if $D(S)$ occurs in sequence $a$. You should find the number of good subtrees of the given tree. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the following $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$.
- The last line contains $N$ space-separated integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of good subtrees modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 500$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- $0 \le d_i \le 9$ for each valid $i$
- $d_1 \neq 0$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $d_i = 2$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```

1 2
2 3
1 6 4

### Example Output
```

```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** All valid subtrees are good (their digit strings are $1$, $16$ and $164$).
