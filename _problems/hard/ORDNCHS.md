**This is an interactive problem.**

Order and Chaos is a two-player game. One player plays as Order, the other as Chaos. The game is played on a $6 \times 6$ grid of cells (both the rows and the columns are numbered $1$ through $6$); initially, all cells are blank. The players alternate turns; Order plays first. On each turn, the current player must place either an 'X' or an 'O' into one blank cell (either player may place either letter).

Let's define a *five-in-a-row* as $5$ contiguous cells in a straight line containing the same letter. A five-in-a-row can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Note that there are only six diagonals which may contain a diagonal five-in-a-row: the main diagonal, the minor diagonal or a diagonal immediately above or below either of them. An *exact five-in-a-row* is a five-in-a-row that is not fully contained within a six-in-a-row.

The game ends when all cells are filled. At this point, if there is an exact five-in-a-row (of either 'X'-s or 'O'-s), then the player that plays as Order wins; otherwise, the player that plays as Chaos wins.

Here are some example games:

```
OOOOOO
OXXXXO
OXOOOO
OXOXXX
OXOXXX
XOOXXX
```

The above is a win for Order. There is a vertical exact five-in-a-row of 'O'-s in the first column. If the 'X' at the bottom of the first column was an 'O' instead, then this would be a win for Chaos, since the five-in-a-row would not be exact. Note that the third row, which contains five 'O'-s, does not contain a five-in-a-row, because these five 'O'-s are not in contiguous cells.

```
OXOOOO
OOXOOO
OOOXOO
OOOOXO
XOOOOX
OXOOXO
```

The above is a win for Order. There is an exact five-in-a-row of 'X'-s just above the main diagonal.

```
XXXXXX
XXOOXX
XOXXOX
XOXXOX
XXOOXX
XXXXXX
```

The above is a win for Chaos.

You are playing this game against the grader. You get to choose whether you want to play as Order or Chaos, but you must win every game.

### Interaction
- First, you should read a line containing a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.
- For each test case, you should start by printing a line containing the string `"ORDER"` or `"CHAOS"` (without quotes) indicating which player you want to play as. Then, the game starts. During each turn, you must do the following:
    - If it is your turn, print a line containing two space-separated integers $r$, $c$, a space and a character $n$, where $n$ must be 'X' or 'O'. This denotes that you want to place the character $n$ into the cell in row $r$ and column $c$.
    - If it is the grader's turn, read a line containing two space-separated integers $r$, $c$, a space and a character $n$, denoting that the grader placed the character $n$ into the cell in row $r$ and column $c$.
- When the game ends, the grader automatically determines the winner.
- Note: If your program attempts to make an invalid move, the grader will immediately exit with a "Wrong Answer" verdict.  You may receive a different verdict if your program subsequently crashes or exceeds the time limit.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line! In C/C++, this can be done after printing each line using `fflush(stdout);` or by setting the proper type of buffering at the beginning of the code using `setlinebuf(stdout);`. Failure to flush the output buffer may result in getting the verdict Time Limit Exceeded.


### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le r, c \le 6$
- $n \in \{\text{'X'}, \text{'O'}\}$

### Interaction
