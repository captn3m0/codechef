There are <b>N-1<\/b> roads connecting these cities such that each pair of cities is connected by a unique path(forming a tree structure). Needless to say, city <b>0<\/b> is the <b>capital<\/b> of Treeland. Initially, each city is controlled by a different gangster. The citizens are allowed to move from any city to any of its adjacent city. However, if the two cities are controlled by different gangsters, they need to pay unit cost in order to move. The distance between any pair u, v of cities denoted by <b>dist(u,v)<\/b>  is defined as the minimum cost a person has to pay to go from <b>u<\/b> to <b>v<\/b>(or v to u).<\/p>\n<p>\nEvery year, a new gangster emerges in the capital. As always, the gangster will wish to expand his territory. To do so, he will choose a city <b>u<\/b>, and march with his gangster army from the <b>capital<\/b> to <b>u<\/b>(along the tree path). All the cities they encounter(including <b>capital<\/b> and <b>u<\/b>) will be forciby occupied by this gangster. Because of this, distance between many cities can potentially change, which makes the people mad. Therefore, they will come to you for help.<\/p>\n<p>\nGiven a city u, they will ask you evaluate <\/p>\n<p><b> f(u) = avg<sub>x in subtree rooted at u(including u)<\/sub>  dist(capital, x) <\/b><\/p>\n<p><h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T<\/b> test cases follows.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N<\/b> denoting the number of cities in Treeland.

The next <b>Q<\/b> lines each contain a character <b>t<\/b> and an integer <b> u <\/b>.<br\/><br \/>\nIf <b>t='O'<\/b>, it means a new gangster has marched from capital to u, Occupying all cities along the path.<br\/><br \/>\nIf <b>t='q'<\/b>, it means you have to report <b>f(u)<\/b><\/br\/><\/br\/><\/p>\n<p><h3>Output<\/h3>\n<li>For each test case, for each query of type 'q', output a single line containing the value of <b> f(u) <\/b>.

The cost of all other edges remains same. Therefore, f(6) becomes 1.\n<\/p>\n","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"utkarsh_lath","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>utkarsh_lath<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":null,"date_added":"26-06-2013","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/medium'>\n                    medium\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/nov13'>\n                    nov13\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/utkarsh_lath'>\n                    utkarsh_lath\n                <\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/MONOPLOY","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1384162200,"submit_start_date":1384162200,"visible_start_date":1384162200,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493556780},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}
