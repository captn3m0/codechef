Danya has a rooted tree with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$). Node $1$ is the root and for each $i$ ($2 \le i \le N$), the parent of the $i$-th node is $p_i$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th node also has a value $a_i$.

Danya really loves his tree and wants to play with it. You should answer his $Q$ queries. In each query:
- You are given two integers $X$ and $D$.
- Consider the set $S$ of all nodes $v$ that lie in the subtree of node $X$ (including $X$) such that the distance between $X$ and $v$ does not exceed $D$.
- The answer to this query is the number of different values $a_v$ among all $v \in S$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N-1$ space-separated integers $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_N$.
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$.
- The fourth line contains a single integer $Q$.
- $Q$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $d$ describing a query; the parameters $X$ and $D$ can be computed in the following way:
    - Let's denote the answer to the previous query by $ans$ ($ans = 0$ if this is the first query).
    - Then, $X = x \oplus ans$ and $D = d \oplus ans$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€• the answer to the query.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le p_i \le i-1$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le a_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $0 \le x, d \le 4 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le X \le N$
- $0 \le D \le N$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (16 points):** $N, Q \le 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (24 points):** the tree is a bamboo, i.e. $p_i = i-1$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints
