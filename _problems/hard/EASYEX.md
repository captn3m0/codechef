One day Chef had an exam on probability theory. Nothing interesting, but the exam was going fishily easy. And finally Chef got to the last question:

 "Suppose you have a dice with **K** faces with numbers from **1** to **K** written on it, and integers **L** and **F**(**0 &lt; L &lt;= K**). You roll it **N** times. Let **ai** be the number of times (out of the **N** rolls) that a face with number **i** written on it came up as the top face of the dice. Find the mathematical expectation of the value **a1F \* a2F \* ... \* aL**F." 

 "I'll drop out of university and won't be allowed to cook" - Chef is frightened! Help him now or he will never be able to please you with tasty dishes again.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following **T** lines describe one test case and contain 4 space-separated integers **N, K, L** and **F**.

### Output

Let the answer for a test case be an fraction **P / Q**, where **P** and **Q** are integers. Let integer **X** be **P \* Q-1 modulo 2003**, where **Q-1 modulo 2003** is the modular multiplicative inverse of **Q** modulo **2003** or 0 if **Q-1 modulo 2003** doesn't exist. For each test case, output a single line containing the integer **X** for this test case.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **50**
- 0 &lt; **N, K** ≤ **109**
- 0 &lt; **F ≤ 1000**
- 0 &lt; **L \* F** ≤ **50 000**
- **Subtask #1\[39 points\]: F = 1**
- **Subtask #2\[61 points\] : no additional constraints**
 
### Example

 ```
<b>Input</b>
1
2 6 2 1

<b>Output:</b>
779
<pre>
### Explanation

We roll the 6-face dice 2 times, and we are interested in the value **a1 \* a2**. The only two possible scenarios when this value is not zero are **(1, 2)** and **(2, 1)**. Both of them have **a1 \* a2 = 1** and happen with probability **1 / 36** each. It means that **P / Q = (1 + 1) / 36 = 1 / 18**, so the answer is, **X = 779**.
