### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/mandarin/BLUECHIP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/russian/BLUECHIP.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/vietnamese/BLUECHIP.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/bengali/BLUECHIP.pdf) as well.

You are given a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$) rooted at vertex $1$. There are $M$ blue tokens (numbered $1$ through $M$) and $1$ red token. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th blue token appears at the root at an integer time $t_i$ seconds and moves to a leaf vertex $v_i$, crossing one edge per second. In the next second after reaching $v_i$, this token disappears.

You control the red token. First, given a starting time $S$, you must choose some leaf vertex of the tree and place it at this vertex at some integer time $t$ seconds such that $t \geq S$. In one second, you can move the red token to any vertex adjacent to its current vertex. Your aim is to move the red token to vertex $1$.

At each integer moment in time, the red token is not allowed to be in the same vertex as any blue token.

Additionally, you have a hidden ability called $K$-*teleport*, which can be used any number of times. Whenever $K$-teleport is used to move the red token from its current vertex $u$ to some vertex $v$ of your choice (possibly $u$ itself), it phases out of existence (so it cannot clash with any blue token) and appears in $v$ at an integer moment in time of your choice which is **at least** $K \cdot \mathrm{dist}(u, v)$ seconds later. Here, $\mathrm{dist}(u, v)$ denotes the shortest distance between vertices $u$ and $v$.

Find the minimum time at which the red token can reach the root without clashing with any blue token.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $S$.
- Each of the next $N - 1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.
- $M$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $t_i$ and $v_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum time at which you can reach the root.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $2 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq K \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq S \leq 10^9$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- $0 \leq t_i \leq 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \leq v_i \leq N$ for each valid $i$
- $v_i$ is a leaf vertex for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** One of the possible solutions is shown below.

At $t = 3$, you may use $3$-teleport from $2$ to $1$, arriving at vertex $1$ at the time $t = 7$, since $3 \cdot \mathrm{dist}(2, 1) = 3$ and $3+3 \leq 7$.

**Example case 2:** One of the possible solutions is shown below.

**Example case 3:** One of the possible solutions is shown below.

At $t = 4$, you may use $6$-teleport from $3$ to $3$, arriving at vertex $3$ at the time $t = 6$, since $6 \cdot \mathrm{dist}(3, 3) = 0$ and $4+0 \leq 6$.
