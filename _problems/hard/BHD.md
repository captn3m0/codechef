When Chef was cooking donuts, thunder suddenly came across the gray-blue sky. That's how Lemon came to Earth, and that's also why she loves DONUTS! Since Lemon is a clever person, she often thinks about some problem before having donuts. This time, she thought about the following problem:

There are $N$ donuts. Each donut is a torus described by parameters $x$, $y$, $z$, $R$, $r$, where the center of the torus has Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, $R$ is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of its tube and $r$ is the radius of the tube. The rotational axis of each torus is parallel with the $z$-axis.

The tori may touch or intersect each other. What is the total volume they take up, i.e. the volume of the union of all $N$ tori?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the following $N$ lines contains five space-separated real numbers $x$, $y$, $z$, $R$ and $r$ describing one torus.

### Output
- Print a single line containing one real number â€” the total volume of the $N$ tori. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{-2}$.

### Constraints
- $1\leq N \le 20$
- $-900 \leq x, y, z \leq 600$
- $ 0.1 \leq r \leq R \leq 50$
