### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG19/hindi/TSEQ.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG19/bengali/TSEQ.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG19/mandarin/TSEQ.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG19/russian/TSEQ.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG19/vietnamese/TSEQ.pdf) as well.

You are given a tree with $N$ vertices numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, initially, vertex $i$ has value $W_i$. The value of each vertex can be either $-1$ or a non-negative integer.

At any time, let's denote the sequence of values of vertices on the path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ by $S(u, v)$. We are interested in replacing each element $-1$ in such a sequence by a non-negative integer (not necessarily the same for each $-1$).

You should process $Q$ queries of five types:
- `UPDATE U X`: Change the value of vertex $U$ to $X$.
- `INCREASING U V A B`: Find the number of ways to replace each $-1$ in the sequence $S(U, V)$ by an integer such that the resulting sequence is **strictly increasing** and contains only integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).
- `DECREASING U V A B`: Find the number of ways to replace each $-1$ in the sequence $S(U, V)$by an integer such that the resulting sequence is **strictly decreasing** and contains only integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).
- `NON-DECREASING U V A B`: Find the number of ways to replace each $-1$ in the sequence $S(U, V)$ by an integer such that the resulting sequence is **non-decreasing** and contains only integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).
- `NON-INCREASING U V A B`: Find the number of ways to replace each $-1$ in the sequence $S(U, V)$ by an integer such that the resulting sequence is **non-increasing** and contains only integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $W_1, W_2, \ldots, W_N$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $U$ and $V$ denoting that vertices $U$ and $V$ are connected by an edge.
- $Q$ lines follow. Each of these lines describes one query in the format given above.

### Output
For each query except the `UPDATE` queries, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of ways to replace each $-1$, modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $1 \le U, V \le N$
- $-1 \le W_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- $0 \le A \le B \le 10^6$
- $-1 \le X \le 10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (10 points):**
- $W_i = -1$ for each valid $i$
- $X = -1$

**Subtask #3 (80 points):** original constraints
