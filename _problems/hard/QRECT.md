<p>You are given a Cartesian plane, and you are asked to support the following three kinds of operations:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><strong>I x1 y1 x2 y2</strong>: add an axes-parallel rectangle on the plane. The bottom-left corner has coordinates <b>(x1, y1)</b>, the top-right one has coordinates <b>(x2, y2)</b> </li>
<li><strong>D index</strong>: remove the retangle that was added during the <strong>index</strong>-th addition operation</li>
<li><strong>Q x1 y1 x2 y2</strong>: output the number of rectangles on the plane that have the common area with the rectangle with a bottom-left corner coordinates <b>(x1, y1)</b> and a top-right corner coordinates <b>(x2, y2)</b>.<br />
Please notice that, even if the two rectangles only share a common point, they are still regarded as sharing common area</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Also, there can be a few same rectangles on the plane, they should be regarded as a few different rectangles.</p>
<p>There are <strong>Q</strong> operations in all, can you fulfill them?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
<p>The next <strong>Q</strong> lines represent the operations you are to deal with. Each of them contains an operation in one of the three forms above.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each <strong>Q</strong>-type operation, output the result on the separate line of the output.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10px;">1 &lt;= <strong>QÂ </strong>&lt;= 100000</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10px;">1 &lt;= <strong>x1</strong> &lt;= <strong>x2</strong> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10px;">1 &lt;= <strong>y1</strong> &lt;= <strong>y2</strong> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></span></li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Example</h3>
<h3>
<pre style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Input:</strong>
5
I 1 1 2 2
I 2 2 3 3
Q 3 3 4 4 
D 2
Q 3 3 4 4

<strong>Output:</strong>
1
0  </pre></h3>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
</div>
<pre>In the third operation, the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has a common point with the given rectangle.
But in the fifth operation, as the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has been removed, so there are no rectangles that has the common area with the given rectangle.</pre>
