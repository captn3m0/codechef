All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT14/mandarin/QRECT.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT14/russian/QRECT.pdf).

You are given a Cartesian plane, and you are asked to support the following three kinds of operations:

- **I x1 y1 x2 y2**: add an axes-parallel rectangle on the plane. The bottom-left corner has coordinates **(x1, y1)**, the top-right one has coordinates **(x2, y2)**
- **D index**: remove the retangle that was added during the **index**-th addition operation
- **Q x1 y1 x2 y2**: output the number of rectangles on the plane that have the common area with the rectangle with a bottom-left corner coordinates **(x1, y1)** and a top-right corner coordinates **(x2, y2)**.
    Please notice that, even if the two rectangles only share a common point, they are still regarded as sharing common area

Also, there can be a few same rectangles on the plane, they should be regarded as a few different rectangles.

There are **Q** operations in all, can you fulfill them?

### Input

The first line contains an integer **Q**.

The next **Q** lines represent the operations you are to deal with. Each of them contains an operation in one of the three forms above.

### Output

For each **Q**-type operation, output the result on the separate line of the output.

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= **Q** &lt;= 100000
- 1 &lt;= **x1** &lt;= **x2** &lt;= 109
- 1 &lt;= **y1** &lt;= **y2** &lt;= 109

### Example

### ```
<pre style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Input:</strong>
5
I 1 1 2 2
I 2 2 3 3
Q 3 3 4 4 
D 2
Q 3 3 4 4

<strong>Output:</strong>
1
0  
<pre>


### Explanation



</pre>In the third operation, the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has a common point with the given rectangle.
But in the fifth operation, as the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has been removed, so there are no rectangles that has the common area with the given rectangle.
