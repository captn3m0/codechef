Chef is helping out at a volunteering center for teaching. A child comes to Chef with a problem that he is not able to solve and asks Chef for his help. The problem is the following:

 Consider an **M × N** grid graph. The vertices in the grid graph are identified by its row and column number, i.e., for a vertex there are two numbers **(i,j)** associated with it, where **1 ≤ i ≤ M** is its row, and **1 ≤ j ≤ N** is its column. There are two types of edges in a grid graph(note that all edges are bidirectional) :

- When **i &lt; M**, there is an edge of weight **down(i, j)** connecting **(i, j)** and **(i+1, j)**;
- When **j &lt; N**, there is an edge of weight **right(i, j)** connecting **(i, j)** and **(i, j+1)**.

 Initially, every vertex has a weight of zero.

 Define the length of a path to be the sum of weights of all the edges in this path. The shortest path between **(i1, j1)** and **(i2, j2)** is the path with the minimum length. Of course, the weights associated with vertices doesn't influence shortest paths at all.

The task in the problem is to process the following 2 types of queries on this graph efficiently :

- **i1** **j1** **i2** **j2** **c** : add **c** to the weights of all vertices in the shortest path between **(i1, j1)** and **(i2, j2)**.
- **i** **j** : return the weight of vertex **(i, j)**.

Chef is confused with the problem but he wants to help the child. Can you help Chef with this problem?

### Input

The first line contains three integers **M, N, Q**. **M** and **N** denotes the graph's size; **Q** denotes the number of queries.

Next **M - 1** lines, each line contains **N** numbers. The **j**-th number in the **i**-th line in this part(i.e., the **(i + 1)**-th line in total) denotes **down(i, j)**.

Next **M** lines, each line contains **N - 1** numbers. The **j**-th number in the **i**-th line in this part(i.e., the **(i + M)**-th line in total) denotes **right(i, j)**.

Next **Q** lines, each line contains 3 or 6 numbers, denoting a query.

### Output

For each query of type 2, output the weight of required vertex.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **M** ≤ **3**
- **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **105**
- **1** ≤ **Q** ≤ **105**
- **1** ≤ **down(i,j), right(i,j)** ≤ **1012**
- In type 1 query : 
    - **1** ≤ **i1, i2** ≤ **M**
    - **1** ≤ **j1, j2** ≤ **N**
    - **1** ≤ **c** ≤ **1013**
    - The shortest path between **(i1, j1)** and **(i2, j2)** is **unique**.
- In type 2 query : 
    - **1** ≤ **i** ≤ **M**
    - **1** ≤ **j** ≤ **N**

### Subtasks

- **Subtask #1 (6 points)**: **N, Q ≤ 103**
- **Subtask #2: (11 points)**: **M = 1**.
- **Subtask #3: (30 points)**: **M = 2**.
- **Subtask #4: (24 points)**: 
    - **down(i,j)** and **right(i,j)** are uniformly randomly generated from **\[1,3 × 1010\]**.
    - Queries are also randomly generated.
    - There is only one test file for this subtask.
- **Subtask #5: (29 points):**: Original Constraints

###  Explanation

 **Example case 1.** See picture below.

 ![](https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/upfiles/QGRID_sample_explanation_mfpOHUo4Bq.png)

 The shortest path between (2,2) and (3,3) is (2,2)-&gt;(2,1)-&gt;(3,1)-&gt;(3,2)-&gt;(3,3). We add 1 to these 5 vertices.

 The shortest path between (2,2) and (1,3) is (2,2)-&gt;(1,2)-&gt;(1,3). We add 2 to these 3 vertices.

 Note that the shortest path between (1,1) and (2,2) is not unique. However, the queried paths are (2,2)-(3,3) and (2,2)-(1,3), and the shortest paths of these pairs of points are unique, so this data is valid.
