You are given a string $S$ containing only decimal digits ('0' through '9') and a number $N$. Your task is to insert an arbitrary number (including zero) of plus signs '+' into $S$ in order to form a valid expression whose value is equal to $N$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a string $S$, followed by a space and an integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string â€” your solution, i.e. the expression obtained after inserting some plus signs into $S$. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

### Constraints 
- $T \le 5$
- $1 \le |S| \le 120$
- $N <= int(S)$. *Notes:* $int(S)$ is the integer value of $S$, if we consider $S$ as an integer.

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $N \lt 10^6$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
15112 28
120012 33
123 123
15489001 10549
```

### Example Output
```
15+11+2
1+20+012
123
1548+9001
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** $S$ is "15112" and $N=28$. We can put a plus sign before the third character and another plus sign before the last character of this string to form the expression $15+11+2$, which is equal to $28$.
