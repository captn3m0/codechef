All submissions for this problem are available.Alice is the queen of ChefLand. She has initiated a road reform recently. The reform will last for **M** days.

Initially, there are **N** towns and no roads in ChefLand. Every day one bidirectional road will be built. On the **i**-th day, the road connecting the towns **Ai** and **Bi** will be built.

Nevertheless, Alice worries that if there is a road that will occur in **every** route from the town **A** to the town **B** for some pair of towns **A** and **B**, criminals might attack everyone who is traveling from the town **A** to the town **B** (or vice versa) for sure. So she calls such an unordered pair (**A**, **B**) *unsafe*.

You are given a plan of the road reform. Please, output the number of unsafe unordered pairs of towns, after each of **M** days.

### Input

The first line of input consists of the numbers **N** and **M** - the number of towns and the number of days.

The following **M** lines will describe the road reform. The **i**-th line will contain two integers **X** **Y**. That means that the bidirectional road, connecting the towns **X** and **Y** will be built during the **i**-th day.

### Output

Output **M** lines. The **i**-th line should contain the number of unsafe pairs of towns after the **i**-th day.

### Scoring

Subtask 2 (13 points): 1 &lt;= **N** &lt;= 100, 1 &lt;= **M** &lt;= 100.

Subtask 3 (20 points): 1 &lt;= **N** &lt;= 5000, 1 &lt;= **M** &lt;= 5000.

Subtask 4 (45 points): 1 &lt;= **N** &lt;= 5\*105, 1 &lt;= **M** &lt;= 5\*105.
