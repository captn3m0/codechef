{"category_name":"hard","status":"success","problem_code":"ICPC16G","problem_name":"Robolympic Batons","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p>Today is the Robolympics athletic event. <b>N<\/b> batons numbered 0 to <b>N - 1<\/b> are placed in a circular fashion where baton numbers increase in clockwise direction. Also, some of the batons are <i>special<\/i>. <b>M<\/b> robots start in the event by standing near a baton position and picking it up. Note that a baton cannot be held by more than one robot, therefore all robots have distinct positions in the circular array of batons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, this event lasts for <b>N<\/b> seconds. In each second, each robot drops the baton currently in its hand and moves to next position in clockwise direction <i>i.e.<\/i> if a robot has baton <b>i<\/b> in its hand at <b>t = 0<\/b>, at <b>t = 1<\/b> he will be holding baton <b>(i + 1) % N<\/b>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>Crowd goes berserk whenever there comes a moment when all robots have picked up <i>special<\/i> batons. Your aim is to count how many times it will happen during the whole race. Note that crowd can go berserk even at <b>t = 0<\/b>. But since race is over at <b>t = N<\/b>, crowd doesn't care anymore. e. The crowd will not go berserk at <b>t = N<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>N<\/b> and <b>M<\/b> denoting the number of batons and number of robots participating in the event.

Next line contains <b>M<\/b> integers denoting the index(0 to N-1) of initial baton that robots have picked up.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output one and only integer denoting the required answer.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 <b>5*10<sup>5<\/sup><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>M<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/sup><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input 1:<\/b>\n3 1\n1 0 1\n0\n\n<b>Output 1:<\/b>\n2\n\n<pre><b>Input 2:<\/b>\n4 2\n1 0 1 0\n1 3\n\n<b>Output 2:<\/b>\n2\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p><b>Example input 1.<\/b> <br\/>\nBatons numbered 0 and 2 are <i>special<\/i>.\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 0<\/b>: [0]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 1<\/b>: [1]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 2<\/b>: [2]\n\nNote that at <b>t = 0, 2<\/b> all robots have special batons held.\n<br\/>\n<b>Example input 2.<\/b> <br\/>\nBatons numbered 0 and 2 are <i>special<\/i>.\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 0<\/b>: [1, 3]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 1<\/b>: [2, 0]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 2<\/b>: [3, 1]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 3<\/b>: [0, 2]\n\nNote that at <b>t = 1, 3<\/b> all robots have special batons held.\n<\/p>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.4","max_timelimit":"5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin3","problem_author_html_handle":"admin3","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"18-10-2016","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin3'>\n                    admin3\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1477153800,"submit_start_date":1477153800,"visible_start_date":1477153800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493556973},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}
