###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

Johnny has been hired to write a program to analyse strategic data for the Bytelandian Navy. His task is described below.

There are N battleships represented as N points on the plane. The **radius** of a ship is defined to be the distance from that ship to the ship closest to it. The **effective set** for a ship is defined to be the set of all ships (excluding itself) which are at a distance from that ship of **no more than twice** its radius. The number of elements in the effective set of a ship is called the **effective value** of that ship.

Johnny needs to write a program to calculate the radius and the effective value of each battleship. This task is so tough that without your help, Johnny could never finish it. Let's help him!

### Input

The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 5). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:

- The first line contains an integer N, the number of battleships (1 < N <= 30000).
- Each line in the next N lines contains two integers X, Y (0 <= X, Y <= 10000) represents the coordinates of a battleship.

Each test case's input is separated by a blank line. There may be more than one ships located at the same place.

### Output

For each test case, print N lines. Each line should contain two numbers which are the radius and the effective value of the corresponding battleship. The radius should be rounded to 2 decimal points.

Print a blank line after each test case's output.
