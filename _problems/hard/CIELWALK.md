###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

Today, Ciel's restaurant is closed. Ciel is bored, so she decides to take a walk randomly.

This town has **N** intersections and **M** one way roads. The **i**-th road connects from the **Ai**-th intersection to the **Bi**-th intersection. Ciel is in the 1st intersection now, and Ciel's house is in the **N**-th intersection.

If Ciel is in the **i**-th intersection, she will take a walk as follows:

- If **i** = **N**, her walk is ended.
- Otherwise, she chooses an integer **k** such that **Ak** = **i** uniformly randomly, she walks along the **k**-th road.

On the way, **S** intersections have beautiful flowers. Let the **F**1-th intersection, the **F**2-th intersection, ..., and the **FS**-th intersection have beautiful flowers. Can you tell the probability that Ciel last sees the flowers in the **Fi**-th intersection? That is to say, can you tell the probability that she visits the **Fi**-th intersection, then she goes to **N**-th intersection without visiting other intersections having beautiful flowers?

### Input

The first line contains 3 integers **N**, **M** and **S**. Then, next line has **S** integers **F**1, **F**2, ..., **FS**. Next **M** lines have 2 integers each, **Ai** and **Bi**.

### Output

An output should contain **S** lines. In the **i**-th line, print the probability that Ciel last sees beautiful flowers at the **Fi**-th intersection. These values must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.

### Constraints

1 ≤ **S** &lt; **N** ≤ 30
1 ≤ **F1** &lt; **F2** &lt; ... &lt; **FS** &lt; N
**Ai** ≠ **Bi**
If **i** ≠ **j** and **Ai** = **Aj**, then **Bi** ≠ **Bj**
For each 1 ≤ **i** &lt; **N**, Ciel can go from the **i**-th intersection to the **N**-th intersection, directly or indirectly.

### Notes

The sum of output values can be less than 1, because Ciel may go back to her house without seeing beautiful flowers.
