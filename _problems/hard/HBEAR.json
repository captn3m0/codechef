{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Little Bear had just come back from school. He was very hungry that time and wanted at least K units of honey to satisfy his hunger. He immediately went to a rectangular field of size N x M to collect some honey. He wanted to collect honey only\nin a special sub-rectangle which has size S x T where S&lt;=A and T&lt;=B, for some fixed A and B. He has Q queries, each query contains A, B. For each query, he wanted to know how many special sub-rectangles contain at least K units of honey. \n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input contains integers N, M  and K(1&lt;=N, M&lt;=300, 1&lt;=K&lt;=N*M). \nThe next N lines contain M characters (either 'H' or '.'). 'H' means there is honey in that cell, while '.' means there is no honey in that cell.\nThe next line contains an integer Q (1&lt;=Q&lt;=100 000).\nThe next Q lines contain integers A and B (1&lt;=A&lt;=N , 1&lt;=B&lt;=M).\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The output contains Q lines, each line contains the number of special sub-rectangles which satisfy the requirement. (The amount of honey is at least K inside the special sub-rectangle)\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n<code>\n5 5 4\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\nHHHH.\nHH..H\n2\n1 1\n2 3\n<\/code>\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n\n0\n4\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<b>Explanation for 2nd query<\/b>\n<pre>\n<code>\n#: means the chosen cell\nThe possibilities are:\n1.
