You are given a tree with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N-1$ edges. Each node has a value; let's denote the value of node $x$ by $W_x$.

Next, let's define the value of a simple path $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$ as $\sum_{i=1}^k i \cdot W_{v_i}$. A simple path in a tree is a sequence of nodes $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$ such that:
- $k \ge 1$
- there is an edge between nodes $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ for each $i$ ($1 \le i \le k-1$)
- $v_i \neq v_j$ for each $i, j$ ($1 \le i, j \le k$) such that $i \neq j$

You should find the maximum of values of all simple paths in the given tree.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $W_1, W_2, \dots, W_N$.
- Each of the following $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum value of a simple path.

### Constraints
- $2 \le N \le 50,000$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- $u \neq v$
- $|W_i| \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- the graph described in the input is a tree

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** the tree is a binary tree rooted at node 1

**Subtask #2 (30 points):**
- the length (number of nodes) of any simple path in the tree is at most $200$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100,000$

**Subtask #3 (40 points):** original constraints
