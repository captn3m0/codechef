Chefs best scientist Pramod has designed a new Fighter Plane which can fly with Speed of Light!! So none of the defence forces of Byteland can defeat or defend it.<\/p>\n<p>Byteland has a structure of a tree with <b>N<\/b> cities connected by <b>N-1<\/b> bidirectional roads. Each city has index between (<b>1<\/b>, <b>N<\/b>) (inclusive) and no two cities have same index. The capital city of Byteland has index <b>1<\/b>. The distance between two cities is the number of roads in the path from one to other.<\/p>\n<p>If the plane drops a bomb on a city <b>A<\/b>, with damage value <b>X<\/b> then the damage done to a city <b>B<\/b> will be floor(<b>X\/2<sup>d<\/sup><\/b>) where <b>d<\/b> is the distance between <b>A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b>, note that as the distance of <b>A<\/b> from itself is <b>0<\/b>, the damage done to <b>A<\/b> will be floor(<b>X\/2<sup>0<\/sup><\/b>) = <b>X<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Each city has a certain wealth <b>W<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> in it, if it is damaged by a value of <b>X<\/b> then its wealth is reduced by <b>X<\/b>. On a day if the wealth of a city becomes less than or equal to zero then it is considered Economically Dead.<\/p>\n<p>Your task is to write a program that keeps track of the bombings done by the plane and answer the queries asked by the chef. The chef has a total of <b>Q<\/b> queries for you. There are two types of queries.<br \/><br \/>1) Chef gives you two integers <b>A<\/b> and <b>X<\/b>, which means that the plane drops a bomb on the city with index <b>A<\/b> with damage value <b>X<\/b>. A bomb can also be dropped on economically dead city.<br \/>2) Chef gives you an integer <b>A<\/b> and you need to print the number of cities that are economically dead which have <b>A<\/b> in the path from the capital to them.<br \/>(See explanation for better understanding)<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>First line contains an Integer representing <b>N<\/b> the number of cites.<br \/>Next <b>N<\/b> lines contain one integer each, integer on the <b>i<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> line represents the <b>W<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, wealth of the city with index <b>i<\/b>.<br \/>Next <b>N - 1<\/b> lines contain two integers <b>U<\/b> and <b>V<\/b> each, which means that there is a road connecting cities <b>U<\/b> and <b>V<\/b>.<br \/>Next line contains an integer <b>Q<\/b>, the number of Queries.<br \/>Next <b>Q<\/b> lines represent one query each, if the first integer in the line is <b>1<\/b> then the query is of type <b>1<\/b>, it is followed by two integers <b>A<\/b> and <b>X<\/b>, else the query is of type <b>2<\/b>, it is followed by one integer <b>A<\/b>.(The meanings of the variables are well explained in the question)<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each query of type <b>2<\/b> print the required value asked in the question.<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= <b>N<\/b> &lt;= 10<sup>5<\/sup> <br \/>1 &lt;= <b>Q<\/b> &lt;= 10<sup>5<\/sup> <br \/>1 &lt;= <b>A<\/b> &lt;= <b>N<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>1 &lt;= <b>U, V<\/b> &lt;= <b>N<\/b>, <b>U<\/b> \u2260  <b>V<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>1 &lt;= <b>X<\/b> &lt;= 10<sup>5<\/sup><br \/>1 &lt;= <b>W<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> &lt;= 10<sup>9<\/sup><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Sample Input<\/b>\n4\n2\n5\n5\n2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4\n1 3 4\n2 2\n1 2 2\n2 1\n<b>Sample Output<\/b>\n1\n3\n<\/pre><h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>Path from Capital to City 1 : 1<\/p>\n<p>Path from Capital to City 2 : 1 &lt;--> 2<\/p>\n<p>Path from Capital to City 3 : 1 &lt;--> 2 &lt;--> 3<\/p>\n<p>Path from Capital to City 4 : 1 &lt;--> 2 &lt;--> 3 &lt;--> 4<\/p>\n<p>Cities having 1 in the path connected to Capital City : (1,2,3,4)<\/p>\n<p>Cities having 2 in the path connected to Capital City : (2,3,4)<\/p>\n<p>Cities having 3 in the path connected to Capital City : (3,4)<\/p>\n<p>Cities having 4 in the path connected to Capital City : (4)<\/p>\n<p>Distances of cities from city 1 : (0,1,2,3)<\/p>\n<p>Distances of cities from city 2 : (1,0,1,2)<\/p>\n<p>Distances of cities from city 3 : (2,1,0,1)<\/p>\n<p>Distances of cities from city 4 : (3,2,1,0)<\/p>\n<p>Initial Wealths of the Cities : (2,5,5,2)<\/p>\n<p>On the First Day a Bomb of Damage 4 is Dropped on City 3.
