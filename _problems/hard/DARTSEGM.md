Alice and Bob are playing a game.

First, Alice throws $N$ darts at a board with dimensions $10^9 \times 10^9$ at random. Each dart hits the board at a point (some of these points may coincide). Then, Bob should answer Alice's $Q$ questions. In each question, Alice chooses two integers $l$ and $r$; Bob should only consider all points hit in throws $l$ through $r$ (inclusive) and compute the distance between the farthest pair of these points.

Help Bob find the answers to all queries.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of points.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ denoting the coordinates of the point hit with the $i$-th dart.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of queries.
- Each of the following $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $l$ and $r$ describing one query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the square of the maximum distance. (It is guaranteed that this number is an integer.)

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N, Q \le 50,000$
- $1 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$ for each $i$
- $1 \le l \le r \le N$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 200$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 2000$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1 1
2 2
1
1 2
```

### Example Output
```
2
```


### Test Case Generation
In each test case, the points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_N, y_N)$ are generated randomly uniformly from the $10^9 \times 10^9$ square.
