Each square in the grid contains an integer A. You are given a supply of rectangular 2 \u00d7 1 tiles, each of which exactly covers two adjacent squares of the grid. You have to place tiles to cover all the squares in the grid such that each tile covers two squares and no pair of tiles overlap.<\/p>\n<p>The score for a tile is the di\ufb00erence between the bigger and the smaller number that are covered by the tile. The aim of the game is to maximize the sum of the scores of all the tiles.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of a grid, along with two different tilings and their scores.The score for Tiling 1 is 12 = (9 \u2212 8) + (6 \u2212 2) + (7 \u2212 1) + (3 \u2212 2) while the score for Tiling\u00a02 is 6 = (8 \u2212 6) + (9 \u2212 7) + (3 \u2212 2) + (2 \u2212 1). There are other tilings possible for this grid,\u00a0but you can check that Tiling 1 has the maximum score among all tilings.\u00a0Your task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be\u00a0achieved by any tiling of the grid.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/download\/extimages\/7a5dce34b65f397e0b2b7b4fc7eb78d0.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be achieved by any tiling of the grid.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Input<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The \ufb01rst line contains one integer N, the number of columns in the grid.
