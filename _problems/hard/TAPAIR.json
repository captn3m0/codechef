Besides, the road system is connected it means people can travel between any two cities. It is decided by the president that two roads will be concurrently upgraded in the next month. Since it may take a couple of weeks to get the work done, two roads should be chosen so that the connectivity of the system is hold during the up-gradation process. More clearly, people still can go between any pair of cities without using that two roads.\n<\/p>\n<p>Which roads should be upgraded is not decided yet. There may be no way to choose such a two roads or may be many ways. Your mission is counting how many pair of roads <b>cannot<\/b> be chosen. Notice that two roads must be different and we consider only un-ordered pair ((1, 2) is the same as (2,1)).<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains two integers <b>N M<\/b> which are the number of cities and roads respectively.
