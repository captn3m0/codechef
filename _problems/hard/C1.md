###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

You are given a sequence w of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w\[i\] and w\[i+1\], that w\[i\]&gt;w\[i+1\]+1. As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.

### Input

First - 1&lt;=t&lt;=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1&lt;=n&lt;=100000. Then, n nonnegative integers.

### Output

For each test, you should output exactly n integers.
