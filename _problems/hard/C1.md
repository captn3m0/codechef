<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>You are given a sequence w of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]&gt;w[i+1]+1.
As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.


<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>First - 1&lt;=t&lt;=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1&lt;=n&lt;=100000. Then, n nonnegative integers.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>For each test, you should output exactly n integers.

<h3>Example</h3>
