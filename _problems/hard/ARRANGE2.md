<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>
A number X is called Permut number if X and 2X ( both without leading zeroes ) have same number of digits and are permutations of each other. Given A and B, find the number of Permut numbers &gt;= A and &lt;= B.
</p>

<p>
Note : X is called permutation of Y if every digit ( 0 - 9 ) occurs same number of times in both the numbers ( maybe at different positions ).
</p>

<p>
Input :
</p>
