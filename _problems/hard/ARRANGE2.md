A number X is called Permut number if X and 2X ( both without leading zeroes ) have same number of digits and are permutations of each other. Given A and B, find the number of Permut numbers &gt;= A and &lt;= B.

Note : X is called permutation of Y if every digit ( 0 - 9 ) occurs same number of times in both the numbers ( maybe at different positions ).

Input :

The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, containing two integers A and B.

Output :

Output T lines, one for each test case containing the desired answer for the corresponding test case.
