**The problem statement has been updated.**

**The time limit for this problem is now 5 seconds.**

You are given n discs on plane, of the same radius (r=1). Output the area of the part of the plane which is covered by **each** disc.

### Input

First, 1<=t<=10, the number of tests. Each testcase is of the following form: 1<=n<=100000, then n pairs of floating point coordinates follow: -1000<=xi,yi<=1000, representing the location of the i-th disc.

### Output

For each testcase, output the total area covered by the intersection of all discs. Round the answer to 6 decimal digits after the point.
