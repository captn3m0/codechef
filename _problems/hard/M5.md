<p>You are given n discs on plane, of the same radius (r=1). Output the area of the part of the plane which is covered by <b>each</b> disc.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First, 1&lt;=t&lt;=10, the number of tests. Each testcase is of the following form: 1&lt;=n&lt;=100000, then n pairs of floating point coordinates follow: -1000&lt;=x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>&lt;=1000, representing the location of the i-th disc.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase, output the total area covered by the intersection of all discs. Round the answer to 6 decimal digits after the point.</p>
