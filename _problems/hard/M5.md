You are given n discs on plane, of the same radius (r=1). Output the area of the part of the plane which is covered by **each** disc.

### Input

First, 1&lt;=t&lt;=10, the number of tests. Each testcase is of the following form: 1&lt;=n&lt;=100000, then n pairs of floating point coordinates follow: -1000&lt;=xi,yi&lt;=1000, representing the location of the i-th disc.

### Output
