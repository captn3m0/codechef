A non-negative number is called "*$S$ semi-palindromic*" if it is divisible by $S$ and it is possible to rearrange its digits in such a way that the resulting number is palindromic. If the initial number had $D$ digits (without leading zeroes), consider the number obtained by rearranging to have exactly $D$ digits as well (leading zeroes are allowed).

Compute the number of "$S$ semi-palindromic" numbers smaller than $10^K$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $S$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 20$
- $1 \le S \le 16$
- $1 \le K \le 10^{18}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask 1 (10 points):**
- $S \le 2$
- $K \le 10^5$

**Subtask 2 (20 points):** $S \le 2$

**Subtask 3 (70 points):** original constraints

### Explanation

**Example case 1:** The $1$ semi-palindromic numbers are $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99$.
