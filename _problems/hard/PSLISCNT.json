This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le N \\le 500\\,000$\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le N$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/russian\/PSLISCNT.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/mandarin\/PSLISCNT.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/vietnamese\/PSLISCNT.pdf) as well.\n\nLet's denote the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the array $B$ by $\\mathbf{LIS}(B)$. \n\nFor a permutation $A$ of integers from $1$ to $N$ we can define two arrays of integers $P$ and $S$, both of length $N$: $P_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[1:i]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_i])$, $S_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[i:N]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_N])$.\n\nLet's call a pair of arrays $(P, S)$  $\\mathit{viable}$, if there exists a permutation $A$ with these arrays as $P$ and $S$.\n\nGiven array $P$ of length $N$, calculate the number of arrays $S$ such that $(P, S)$ is viable, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains one integer $N$ $-$ the length of the array $P$.\n\n- The second line of input contains $N$ integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"Print a single integer $-$ the answer to the problem modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"3\n1 2 3\n","output":"1\n","explanation":"It can be shown that the only array $S$, for which pair $(P, S)$ is viable, is $[3, 2, 1]$.","isDeleted":false},{"id":"2","input":"3\n3 3 3\n","output":"0\n","explanation":"It can be shown that there is no permutation with such array $P$.","isDeleted":false},{"id":"3","input":"6\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n","output":"2\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false},{"id":"4","input":"8\n1 2 3 3 4 4 4 4\n","output":"7\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false},{"id":"5","input":"17\n1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 7\n","output":"28\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"10","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"um_nik","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #D0011B;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>7&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>um_nik<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"3-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/hard'>hard<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/sdelp21'>sdelp21<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/snckel21'>snckel21<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/um_nik'>um_nik<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/PSLISCNT","time":{"view_start_date":1638723600,"submit_start_date":1638723600,"visible_start_date":1638723600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797999},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=PSLISCNT","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
