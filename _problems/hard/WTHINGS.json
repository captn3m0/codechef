{"category_name":"hard","status":"success","problem_code":"WTHINGS","problem_name":"Where the Wild Things Are","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><h3> Read problems statements in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK47\/mandarin2\/WTHINGS.pdf\">Mandarin Chinese<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK47\/russian\/WTHINGS.pdf\">Russian<\/a> as well.<\/h3>\n<p>Recently, Max has visited the place where the Wild Things are again. He was very happy to know, that the monsters are living in peace now.<\/p>\n<p>His friend Carol was so excited about Max's coming back, that he proposed everyone a brand new game. Unfortunately, all the Wild Things refused to play the game, except Max and K.W., so there were only three players playing the game.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/download\/extimages\/4e92b0bc21bd247da871da4a6fb7eb79.jpg\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The area, where the game takes place, is the Cartesian plane(<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cartesian_plane\">link<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>There are <b>N<\/b> <i>interesting<\/i> points on the plane.  Each <i>interesting<\/i> point has integer coordinates. Also, all the <i>interesting<\/i> points form a strictly convex polygon(<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convex_polygon#Strict_convexity\">link<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p>There is no need to explain the rules of the game, but it's quite important to mention the preparation process:<\/p>\n<p>In order to play the game, the players(Max, K.W. and Carol) must choose three different <i>interesting<\/i> points<br \/>\nand plant  themselves there. Also, they must choose some positive integer <b>S<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>\nLet's assume, that Max's <i>interesting<\/i> point is <b>A<\/b>, K.W.'s - <b>B<\/b> and Carol's - <b>C<\/b>.<br \/>\nIf the area of triangle <b>ABC<\/b> is greater than or equal to <b>S<\/b>, then the game will be <i>awesome<\/i>.<br \/>\n Otherwise, it will be <i>awful<\/i>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNow Max is on his way home. His head is filled up with the memories about the wonderful game he used to play with<br \/>\nhis friends. But there's the thing, that annoys him: he remembers, that he played the game <b>Q<\/b> times, but<br \/>\nhe can't recall any <i>interesting<\/i> point chosen by him!\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMax exactly remembers, that in the beginning of <b>i<\/b>'th game K.W. chose point <b>B<\/b> = <b>B<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>,<br \/>\nCarol chose point <b>C<\/b> = <b>C<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>S<\/b> was equal to <b>S<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.<br \/>\nAlso, he remembers, that all the games were awesome.<br \/>\nSo, you are to calculate the number of different <i>interesting<\/i> points,<br \/>\nthat could be chosen by Max as <b>A<\/b> in the beginning of <b>i<\/b>'th game. This number can be equal to zero(in that case we can conclude, that <b>i<\/b>'th game wasn't awesome - anyway, just output zero).\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of a test case contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>Q<\/b>,<br \/>\ndenoting the number of the <i>interesting<\/i> points and the number of times Max played the game.<\/p>\n<p>The next <b>N<\/b> lines contain two integers <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> each, denoting coordinates of <b>i<\/b>'th <i>interesting<\/i> point.
