Chef and his wife Chefina started playing a new game.

At the beginning of the game, Chefina secretly writes down a matrix $A$ with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered $1$ through $N$). All elements of this matrix are distinct positive integers. Then, Chefina asks Chef to find the position (row and column) of the element with value $V$, or determine that such an element does not occur in $A$. Chef does not know the matrix $A$, but he can ask Chefina at most $K$ questions about it. Each question must be in the format $1\, r\, c$; Chefina answers Chef with the number $A_{r, c}$.

Since this task is really hard for Chef, Chefina decided to give him additional help â€” she told Chef that the matrix she writes down has a special property: each row and each column is sorted in some order (descending or ascending). Different rows and columns may be sorted in different order.

Chef may ask at most $K$ questions in the format above. Afterwards, he must tell Chefina the position of the element $V$ in the format $2\, i\, j$, with the meaning that $A_{i, j} = V$ if $V$ occurs in $A$, or with $i=j=-1$ if $V$ does not occur in $A$.

This is an interactive problem. You should play the game for Chef; the grader plays for Chefina.

### Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $K$ and $V$.

### Interaction
To ask a question, print one line containing three space-separated integers $1$, $r$ and $c$ to the output. Then, read the answer to this question from the input. The answer for an invalid question is $-1$.

You may ask at most $K$ questions. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Finally, print the answer as one line containing three space-separated integers $2$, $i$ and $j$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $1 \le A_{i, j} \le 10^9$ for each valid $i, j$
- $1 \le V \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $K = N \cdot N$

**Subtask #2 (20 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $K = 11,000$

**Subtask #3 (30 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $K = 6,000$

**Subtask #4 (40 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $K = 4,000$

### Example Input
```
3 10 4
```

**Interaction**

```
Chef             Chefina
1 1 1
                 2
1 1 2
                 6
1 2 1
                 4
2 2 1
```

### Explanation
Chefina wrote down a matrix with $3$ columns and $3$ rows. Chef needs to find the number $4$ in at most $10$ questions. One possible matrix $A$ could be:
```
2  6  8
4  9 12
7 11 13
```
