All submissions for this problem are available.There is a **RxC** grid where the rows are numbered by integers from **1** to **R** from top to bottom and columns are numbered by integers from **1** to **C** from left to right. Two cells of the grid are called adjacent if they share a common side.



Chef uses an algorithm which starts at a cell **(sr,sc)** of the grid and visits the unvisited adjacent cells inside the grid recursively. The order in which the adjacent cells are looked for are: right, down, left and up. Your job is to find out the number of different cells that would be visited when the cell **(tr,tc)** is found. Given below is the pseudocode of the algorithm:

<pre>
// A 2D boolean array to mark the visited cells
Let seen[1...R][1...C] be a 2D array initialized to false

// The visit counter to count the number of visited cells so far
visitcount = 0 

// This function visits the unvisited cells of the grid recursively
// R,C are the number of rows and columns of the grid
// r,c are the row and column number of the current cell 
// tr,tc are the row and column number of the target cell 
VISIT(R, C, r, c, tr, tc)
     // Increment the counter for number of visited cells
     visitcount = visitcount + 1 
  
     // Marks the cell at r,c as visited
     seen[r][c]=true           
  
     // Prints the value of visitcount when the cell(tr,tc) is found
     if r==tr and c==tc  
	    PRINT visitcount

     // Check for an unvisited cell inside grid at right
     if c+1 ≤ C and seen[r][c+1] == false 
	    VISIT(R,C,r,c+1,tr,tc)
    
     // Check for an unvisited cell inside grid at down
     if r+1 ≤ R and seen[r+1][c] == false 
	     VISIT(R,C,r+1,c,tr,tc)
  
     // Check for an unvisited cell inside grid at left
     if c-1 ≥ 1 and seen[r][c-1] == false 
	     VISIT(R,C,r,c-1,tr,tc)
  
     // Check for an unvisited cell inside grid at up
     if r-1 ≥ 1 and seen[r-1][c] == false 
	     VISIT(R,C,r-1,c,tr,tc)

 The above algorithm is both time and memory inefficient. Your task is to produce the same output but more efficiently. That is to print the value of `visitcount` when the cell **(tr,tc)** is found, if the above algorithm is called with `VISIT(R,C,sr,sc,tr,tc)`.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following **T** lines contain six separated integers **R, C, sr, sc, tr and tc.**

### Output

 For each case output the number that would be produced by the algorithm given.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **200000 (2\*105 )**
- **1** ≤ **R,C** ≤ **1000000000 (109 )**
- **1** ≤ **sr,tr** ≤ **R**
- **1** ≤ **sc,tc** ≤ **C**
