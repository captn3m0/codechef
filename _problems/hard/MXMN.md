### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/hindi/MXMN.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/bengali/MXMN.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/mandarin/MXMN.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/russian/MXMN.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/vietnamese/MXMN.pdf) as well.

Chef loves graphs. To express his love, he defines a function $f(G, x, y)$ for an undirected connected graph $G$ with weighted edges and two of its vertices $x$, $y$. $f(G, x, y)$ is defined as the minimum of weights of all paths in $G$ between the vertices $x$ and $y$, where the weight of a path is the maximum of weights of edges in this path.

Chef has two connected graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$. Each of these graphs has $N$ vertices (labelled $1$ through $N$) and $M$ edges. Calculate $$S = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^N f(G_1, i, j) \cdot f(G_2, i, j)$$ modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- $M$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G_1$ are connected by an edge with weight $w$.
- $M$ more lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G_2$ are connected by an edge with weight $w$.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€” the sum $S$ modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $M = 2N$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- $1 \le w \le 10^8$
- $G_1$ and $G_2$ are connected graphs

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $N = 2,000$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):**
- $N = 10^5$
- $G_1$ and $G_2$ are identical graphs

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints
