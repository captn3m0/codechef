They have  <b>n<sub>h<\/sub><\/b> horses, each capable of carrying only one man at a time. All the men are supposed to attend a dinner party <b>d<\/b> km away from their house. They should start their journey together and reach destination in minimum time. Speed of each man is <b>v<sub>m<\/sub><\/b> km\/hour whereas speed of each horse (with or without somebody on back) is <b>v<sub>h<\/sub><\/b> km\/hour. You need to find the minimum time required to complete the journey? For simplicity you can assume the following things:\n <ul>\n     \n     <li>No time is needed in riding a horse or getting down from a horse.<\/li>\n     <li>The horses are very well trained to execute any instruction given to it.<\/li>\n     <li>No time is needed for changing the direction of horse or man.<\/li>\n     <li>The town and the dinner party location can be considered as two different points and all people and horses travel along the straight line connecting these two points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>d (0 &lt; d \u2264 10000)<\/li>\n<li>n<sub>m<\/sub> (1 &lt; n<sub>m<\/sub> \u2264 1000)<\/li>\n<li>n<sub>h<\/sub> (0 &lt; n<sub>h<\/sub> \u2264 1000)<\/li>\n<li>v<sub>m<\/sub> (0 &lt; v<sub>m<\/sub> \u2264 20)<\/li>\n<li>v<sub>h<\/sub> (0 &lt; v<sub>h<\/sub> \u2264 50)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>Each input set consists of  five integers <b>d, n<sub>m<\/sub>, n<sub>h<\/sub>, v<sub>m<\/sub>,  v<sub>h<\/sub><\/b> in a new line.
