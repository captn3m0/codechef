### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/hindi/CHEFWARS.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/bengali/CHEFWARS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/mandarin/CHEFWARS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/russian/CHEFWARS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/vietnamese/CHEFWARS.pdf) as well.

On the ice planet Hoth, Chef has run into his arch-nemesis, DarthForces. Darth has a peculiar fighting style â€• he does not attack, but simply defends and lets his opponent tire himself out.

Chef has a lightsaber which has an *attack power* denoted by $P$. He keeps hitting Darth with the lightsaber. Every time he hits, Darth's health decreases by the current attack power of the lightsaber (by $P$ points), and afterwards, $P$ decreases to $\left\lfloor \frac{P}{2} \right\rfloor$.

If the attack power becomes $0$ before Darth's health becomes $0$ or less, Chef dies. Otherwise, Darth dies. You are given Darth's initial health $H$ and the initial attack power $P$. Tell Chef if he can beat Darth or if he should escape.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $H$ and $P$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the integer $1$ if Chef can beat Darth or $0$ otherwise.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le P \le 10^5$
- $1 \le H \le 10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
10 4
10 8
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Chef attacks with power $4$, Darth's health becomes $6$. Chef attacks with power $2$, Darth's health becomes $4$. Chef attacks with power $1$ and Darth's health becomes $3$, but Chef's attack power becomes $0$.

**Example case 2:** Chef attacks with power $8$, Darth's health becomes $2$. Chef attacks with power $4$, Darth's health becomes $0$. Chef kills Darth.
