On day $i$, he receives $Q_i$ queries. But Chef can answer at most $k$ queries in a single day. \r\n\r\nChef always answers the maximum number of questions that he can on any given day (note however that this cannot be more than $k$). The remaining questions (if any) will be carried over to the next day.\r\n\r\nFortunately, after $n$ days, the queries have stopped.
