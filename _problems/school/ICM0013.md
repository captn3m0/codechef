<p>
You are batting at the pitch and all eyes are on you, the best player in all of IPL!<br>
The opposing team will relentlessly bowl at you an infinite number of balls!<br><br>

You notice that you only ever score a boundary on the $M^{th}$ ball, if $N$ $mod$ $M ≤ N/2$, where $N$ is the lucky number of your T-shirt. Now you wanna know how many boundaries will you hit in total? 
<br><br>
Formally, you are given a positive integer $N$ and you need to find the number of positive integers $M$ such that $N$ $mod$ $M ≤ N/2$.

<hr>
<h3> Input </h3>
<ul>
    <li>The first line contains a single integer $T$, which denotes the number 
        of test cases. The description of each test case follows. 
    </li>

    <li> The first and the only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
    </li>
</ul>



<hr>
<h3> Output </h3>
For each test case, print in a new line, the number of integers $M$ which follow the above condition.


<hr>
<h3>Constraints </h3>
<ul>
    <li> $1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{5}$ </li>
    <li> $1 ≤ N ≤ 2\cdot 10^{9}$ </li>
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>Sample Input </h3>
1
<br>
3


<hr>
<h3>Sample Output </h3>
3


<hr>
<h3>Explanation </h3>
For $ N = 3 $, $N$ $mod$ $M ≤ N/2 $ only for $M={1, 2, 3}$. Hence, the number of possible values of $M$ are 3.
