This time in the $2021$ Tokyo Olympics he is determined to make a new world record. \r\n\r\nThere are mainly $3$ important factors that result in the variation in speed during practice and during competition.\r\n\r\n- The first factor is a difference in track material which results in variation in the speed at competition with respect to practice by a factor of $k1$.\r\n\r\n- The second factor is wind speed which results in variation in the speed at competition with respect to practice by a factor of $k2$.\r\n\r\n- The final factor is the maximum speed achieved during practice. If the maximum speed during practice is $v$ m\/s then in competition it will be $k3 * v$ m\/s.\r\n\r\nGiven Chef's max speed $v$ during practice and the factors $k1, k2, k3$, find whether he will be able to create a new world record, i.e, can he complete $100$ m in less than $9.58$ seconds?\r\n\r\n**Note:** The final time displayed by the Olympics clock is showing after rounding the original time to $2$ places of decimal and is the only measure of runners performance.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

So the time taken to complete the race will be $100 \/ 10.45 = 9.569 = 9.57$ sec after rounding to $2$ places after decimal. Since the time is strictly less than the world record time, therefore Chef can break the record.\r\n\r\n**TestCase 2:**  Final speed of Chef after considering all the factors will be $1 * 1 * 1 * 10.44 = 10.44$ m \/ sec. So the time taken to complete the race will be $100 \/ 10.44 = 9.578 = 9.58$ sec after rounding to $2$ places after decimal. Since the time is equal to the world record time, therefore Chef can't break the record.\r\n\r\n**TestCase 3:**  Final speed of Chef after considering all the factors will be $1 * 1 * 0.9 * 10.44 = 9.396$ m \/ sec. So the time taken to complete the race will be $100 \/ 9.396 = 10.643 = 10.64$ sec after rounding to $2$ places after decimal. Since the time is strictly more than the world record time, therefore Chef can't break the record.\r\n\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/APRIL21\/bengali\/BOLT.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/APRIL21\/mandarin\/BOLT.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/APRIL21\/russian\/BOLT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/APRIL21\/vietnamese\/BOLT.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\n**\"Usain Bolt makes a new world record completing $100$ m in $9.58$ seconds\"**. \r\n\r\nThis news headline has been echoing in Chef's mind since $2009$ when he started his career in sprinting.
