### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/bengali/CMPRSS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/mandarin/CMPRSS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/russian/CMPRSS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/vietnamese/CMPRSS.pdf) as well.

You are given a strictly increasing sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Your task is to compress this sequence.

The *compressed form* of this sequence is a sequence of ranges separated by commas (characters ','). A *range* is either an integer or a pair of integers separated by three dots (the string `"..."`). When each range `a...b` in the compressed form is decompressed into the subsequence $(a, a+1, \ldots, b)$, we should obtain the (comma-separated) sequence $A$ again.

For each maximal contiguous subsequence $(a, a+1, \ldots, b)$ of $A$ such that $b \ge a+2$, the compressed form of $A$ must contain the range `a...b`; if $b \le a+1$, such a sequence should not be compressed into a range. A contiguous subsequence is maximal if it cannot be extended by at least one element of $A$ next to it. It can be proved that the compressed form of any sequence is unique (i.e. well-defined).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string â€• the compressed form of the given sequence.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le A_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- $A_1 \lt A_2 \lt \ldots \lt A_N$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
12
1 2 3 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 15 17
4
4 5 7 8
1
4
```

### Example Output
```
1...3,5,6,8...12,15,17
4,5,7,8
4
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- $(1, 2, 3)$ is a contiguous subsequence with length $3$, so it is replaced by the string `"1...3"`
- $(5, 6)$ is a contiguous subsequence, but only with length $2$, so it is not compressed into a range
- $(8, 9, 10, 11, 12)$ is a contiguous subsequence with length $5$, so it is replaced by `"8...12"`
- the elements $15$, $17$ are unaffected
