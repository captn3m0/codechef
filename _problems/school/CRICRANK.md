### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/russian/CRICRANK.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/mandarin/CRICRANK.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/bengali/CRICRANK.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/vietnamese/CRICRANK.pdf) as well.

In a season, each player has three statistics: runs, wickets, and catches. Given the season stats of two players $A$ and $B$, denoted by $R$, $W$, and $C$ respectively, the person who is better than the other in the most statistics is regarded as the better overall player. Tell who is better amongst $A$ and $B$. It is known that in each statistic, the players have different values.
