### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK128/mandarin/CM164364.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK128/russian/CM164364.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK128/bengali/CM164364.pdf) as well.

There are $n$ chocolates, and you are given an array of $n$ numbers where the $i$-th number $A_i$ is the flavour type of the $i$-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least $x$ number of chocolates for her little brother. 

Find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.


###Input:

The first line contains an integer $T$ --- the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of two integers $n$, $x$ - The number of chocolates Sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother, respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $A_1,\ldots, A_n$, where the $i$-th chocolate has type $A_i$.


###Output:

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours Sabrina can eat.


###Constraints 

$1\le T\le 10$

$1 \le x \le  n \le 2 \cdot 10^5  $ 

$1 \le A_{i} \le 10^9$

Sum of $n$ over all test cases do not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5  $



###Sample Input:

```
3
2 1
1 2
4 2
1 1 1 1
5 3
50 50 50 100 100

```	

###Sample Output:

```
1
1
2

```
	
###EXPLANATION:
In the first test case, she can give any 1 chocolate to her brother and can have the other for herself resulting in 1 flavour type for Sebrina.
