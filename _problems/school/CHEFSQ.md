<p>Chef has a sequence of N numbers. He like a sequence better if the sequence contains his favorite sequence as a substring.
</p>
<p>
Given the sequence and his favorite sequence(F) check whether the favorite sequence is contained in the sequence</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line will contain the number of test cases and are followed by the cases. <br />
Each test case consists of four lines: The length of the sequence, the sequence N,the length of F and the sequence F 
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Print "Yes" if the sequence contains the favourite sequence int it otherwise print "No"
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1&lt;=T&lt;=10 <br />
1<Sizeof(N)&lt;1000 <br />
1<Sizeof(F)<sizeof(N)
