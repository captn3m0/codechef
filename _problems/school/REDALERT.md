### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/REDALERT.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/REDALERT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/REDALERT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/REDALERT.pdf) as well.

Finally a monsoon has come. According to the Meteorological Department, there will be rain in the upcoming $N$ days in the city. Initially, the water level of the city is zero millimetres. The amount of rain on the $i$-th day can be described by an integer $A_i$ as follows:
-  If $A_i \gt 0$, the water level of the city increases by $A_i$ millimetres on the $i$-th day.
-  If $A_i = 0$, there is no rain on the $i$-th day. The water level of the city decreases by $D$ millimetres on such a day. However, if the water level is less than $D$ millimetres before the $i$-th day, then it becomes zero instead.

There will be a red alert in the city if the water level becomes strictly greater than $H$ millimetres on at least one of the $N$ days. Determine if there will be a red alert.
