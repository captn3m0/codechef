### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/mandarin/UNQEQ.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/bengali/UNQEQ.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/russian/UNQEQ.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/vietnamese/UNQEQ.pdf) as well.

For a positive, $\textbf{even}$ integer $N$, we call a pair of arrays $A$ and $B$ to be **interesting** if they satisfy the following conditions :

- $|A| = |B| = N/2$ i.e. the length of array $A$ is equal to the length of array $B$.

- Each integer from $1$ to $N$ occurs exactly once in exactly one of the arrays.

- The $i^{th}$ prefix sum of $A$ is not equal to $i^{th}$ prefix sum of $B$ for all $1 \leq i \leq N/2-1$. Formally, $\displaystyle \sum_{j = 1}^{i} A_j \neq \sum_{j = 1}^{i} B_j$ for all $1 \leq i \leq N/2 - 1$

- Sum of all elements in $A$ is equal to sum of all elements in $B$ i.e. $\displaystyle \sum_{j = 1}^{N/2} A_j = \sum_{j = 1}^{N/2} B_j$

You are given a positive, even integer $N$. If there exists an **interesting** pair of arrays, then print "YES" followed by an interesting pair for this given $N$. If there exists multiple **interesting** pairs of arrays for given $N$, you can print any. Print "NO" in a single line if no such pair exists.
