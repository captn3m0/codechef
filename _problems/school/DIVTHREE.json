So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\r\n    \r\n- **Example case 2:** Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\r\n          \r\n- **Example case 3:** Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JAN21\/hindi\/DIVTHREE.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JAN21\/bengali\/DIVTHREE.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JAN21\/mandarin\/DIVTHREE.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JAN21\/russian\/DIVTHREE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JAN21\/vietnamese\/DIVTHREE.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nChef wants to host some Division-3 contests.
