Katya has a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and an integer $m$.

She defines a *good* sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its non-empty subsequences is divisible by $m$.

Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence $a$. Can you help her?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of good subsequences.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le n \le 30$
- $1 \le m \le 1,000$
- $1 \le a_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le n \le 5$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are no good subsequences.

**Example case 2:** There is exactly one good subsequence of $a$: $[3]$.
