The *greatest common divisor* (GCD) of a sequence is the greatest positive integer which divides each element of this sequence.

You are given a sequence $A$ of positive integers with size $N$. You are allowed to delete up to $N-1$ elements from this sequence. (I.e., you may delete any number of elements, including zero, as long as the resulting sequence is non-empty.) 

Please find the minimum number of elements which have to be deleted so that the GCD of the resulting sequence would be equal to $1$, or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. 
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of elements to delete, or $-1$ if it is impossible to make the GCD equal to $1$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 1,000$
- $1 \le A_i \le 50,000$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $2 \le N \le 3$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2
2 3
2
2 4
```

### Example Output
```
0
-1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The GCD is already equal to $1$, so the answer is $0$.

**Example case 2:** It is impossible to make the GCD equal to $1$, so the answer is $-1$.
