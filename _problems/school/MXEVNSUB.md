### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/MXEVNSUB.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/bengali/MXEVNSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/MXEVNSUB.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/MXEVNSUB.pdf) as well.

You are given an integer $N$. Consider the sequence containing the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ in increasing order (each exactly once). Find the maximum length of its contiguous subsequence with an even sum.
