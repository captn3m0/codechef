### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/bengali/TRAVELPS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/mandarin/TRAVELPS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/russian/TRAVELPS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/vietnamese/TRAVELPS.pdf) as well.

Chef is going on a road trip and needs to apply for inter-district and inter-state travel e-passes. It takes $A$ minutes to fill each inter-district e-pass application and $B$ minutes for each inter-state e-pass application.

His journey is given to you as a binary string $S$ of length $N$ where $0$ denotes crossing from one district to another district (which needs an inter-district e-pass), and a $1$ denotes crossing from one state to another (which needs an inter-state e-pass).

Find the total time Chef has to spend on filling the various forms.
