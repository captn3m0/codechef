This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- The input contains two space-separated characters\n- Each character in the input is one among {`R`, `B`, `G`}.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":" ","subtasksState":true,"statement":"People in Chefland have three different eye colors, namely `brown`, `blue`, and `green`. **`green` is the rarest of the eye colors whereas `brown` is most common.**\n\nThe eye color of the child of two people is **most likely** to be the **most common** eye color between them. \n\nYou are given two characters denoting the eye colors of two people in Chefland.
