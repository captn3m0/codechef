Chef has $N$ items in his shop (numbered $1$ through $N$); for each valid $i$, the price of the $i$-th item is $P_i$. Since Chef has very loyal customers, all $N$ items are guaranteed to be sold regardless of their price.

However, the government introduced a *price ceiling* $K$, which means that for each item $i$ such that $P_i \gt K$, its price should be reduced from $P_i$ to $K$.

Chef's *revenue* is the sum of prices of all the items he sells. Find the amount of revenue which Chef loses because of this price ceiling.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the amount of lost revenue.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10,000$
- $1 \le P_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le K \le 1,000$

### Explanation
**Test Case 1**: The initial revenue is $10 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 24$. Because of the price ceiling, $P_1$ decreases from $10$ to $4$ and $P_5$ decreases from $5$ to $4$. The revenue afterwards is $4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 17$ and the lost revenue is $24 - 17 = 7$.

**Test Case 2**: The initial revenue is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. For each valid $i$, $P_i \le 15$, so there are no changes, the revenue after introduction of the price ceiling is the same and there is zero lost revenue.

**Test Case 3**: The initial revenue is $10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 40$. Since $P_i \gt 5$ for each valid $i$, the prices of all items decrease to $5$. The revenue afterwards is $5 \cdot 5 = 25$ and the lost revenue is $40 - 25 = 15$.
