The only information you have is that it has an odd number of [factors](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Divisor) and that it lies between $1$ and $10^6$ inclusive.\r\n\r\nYou have been challenged by Chef to find his number. You may make up to $2,000$ guesses (queries). Whenever you guess Chef's number, he only tells you if you guessed correctly or not. Can you find Chef's number?\r\n\r\n### Interaction\r\n- First, you should read a line containing a single integer $T$ \u2015 the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- For each test case, you should start by asking queries.\r\n    - To ask a query, you should print a line containing an integer between $1$ and $10^6$ inclusive \u2015 your guess.\r\n    - Then, you should read a line containing a single integer: $1$ if you correctly guessed Chef's secret number, $0$ if your guess was incorrect or $-1$ if your guess is invalid (in particular, smaller than $1$ or greater than $10^6$) or you have asked more than $2,000$ queries.\r\n- As soon as you have correctly guessed Chef's secret number, you should stop asking queries and continue solving the remaining test cases.\r\n\r\nIf you read $-1$, you must immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
