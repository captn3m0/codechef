This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq N, K \\leq 10^9$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (100 points):** Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Chef is throwing a party for his $N$ friends. There is a pizza store nearby and he wants to buy pizza for his friends. Each pizza has exactly $K$ slices. Chef's friends get sad if one gets more slices than the other. Also, Chef gets sad if there are some pizza slices left. More formally, suppose Chef buys $P$ pizzas, then everyone is happy if and only if there is a way to distribute $K \\cdot P$ slices between $N$ friends.\n\nYou need to find the minimum number of pizzas Chef has to buy to share all the slices among his friends so that none of his friends gets sad. Note that Chef hates pizza and doesn't take any slices.","inputFormat":"- First line of input contains $T$, the number of test cases.

And there are $2$ friends. So chef can just buy one pizza and give one slice to one friend and another slice to another friend.\n- **Test case $2$:** One pizza has $3$ slices. And there are $2$ friends. So chef can't share one pizza without being left out with a slice. So he needs to buy at least $2$ pizzas. And if he buys $2$ pizzas, he can give $3$ slices to one friend and $3$ to another. So the minimum number of pizzas chef needs to buy is equal to $2$.\n- **Test case $3$:** One pizza has $2$ slices. And there are $4$ friends. So chef can't share one pizza among the $4$ friends. So he needs to buy at least $2$ pizzas. And if he buys $2$ pizzas, he can give $1$ slice to each of his friends. So the minimum number of pizzas chef needs to buy is equal to $2$.","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/YypNoP9LzIE","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"0.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"suryaprak_adm","problem_author_html_handle":"suryaprak_adm","problem_tester":"aryanc403","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>aryanc403<\/span>","date_added":"22-11-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime102'>ltime102<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/math'>math<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/suryaprak_adm'>suryaprak_adm<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/MINPIZZAS","time":{"view_start_date":1638032400,"submit_start_date":1638032400,"visible_start_date":1638032400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797736},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=MINPIZZAS","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
