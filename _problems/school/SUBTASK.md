Chef recently solved his first problem on CodeChef. The problem he solved has $N$ test cases. He gets a score for his submission according to the following rules:

1) If Chef’s code passes all the $N$ test cases, he gets $100$ points.

2) If Chef’s code does not pass all the test cases, but passes all the **first** $M\;(M \lt N)$ test cases, he gets $K\;(K \lt 100)$ points.

3) If the conditions $1$ and $2$ are not satisfied, Chef does not get any points (i.e his score remains at $0$ points).

You are given a binary array $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ of length $N$, where $A_i = 1$ denotes Chef's code passed the $i^{th}$ test case, $A_i = 0$ denotes otherwise. You are also given the two integers $M, K$. Can you find how many points does Chef get?
