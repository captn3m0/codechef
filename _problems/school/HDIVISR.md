### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/hindi/HDIVISR.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/bengali/HDIVISR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/mandarin/HDIVISR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/russian/HDIVISR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/vietnamese/HDIVISR.pdf) as well.

You are given an integer $N$. Find the largest integer between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive) which divides $N$.

### Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer $N$. 

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the largest divisor of $N$ between $1$ and $10$.

### Constraints
- $2 \leq N \leq 1,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input 1
```
24
```

### Example Output 1
```
8
```

### Explanation
The divisors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24$, out of which $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8$ are in the range $[1, 10]$. Therefore, the answer is $\max(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8) = 8$.

### Example Input 2
```
91
```

### Example Output 2
```
7
```

### Explanation
The divisors of $91$ are $1, 7, 13, 91$, out of which only $1$ and $7$ are in the range $[1, 10]$. Therefore, the answer is $\max(1, 7) = 7$.
