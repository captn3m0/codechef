All submissions for this problem are available.### Read problems statements in [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH18/mandarin/BIGSALE.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH18/russian/BIGSALE.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH18/vietnamese/BIGSALE.pdf) as well.

Chef recently opened a big e-commerce website where her recipes can be bought online. It's Chef's birthday month and so she has decided to organize a big sale in which grand discounts will be provided.

In this sale, suppose a recipe should have a discount of **x** percent and its original price (before the sale) is **p**. Statistics says that when people see a discount offered over a product, they are more likely to buy it. Therefore, Chef decides to first increase the price of this recipe by **x**% (from **p**) and then offer a discount of **x**% to people.

Chef has a total of **N** types of recipes. For each **i** (1 ≤ **i** ≤ **N**), the number of recipes of this type available for sale is **quantityi**, the unit price (of one recipe of this type, before the **x**% increase) is **pricei** and the discount offered on each recipe of this type (the value of **x**) is **discounti**.

Please help Chef find the total loss incurred due to this sale, if all the recipes are sold out.

### Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N** denoting the number of recipe types.
- **N** lines follow. The **i**-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers **pricei**, **quantityi** and **discounti** describing the **i**-th recipe type.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the total amount of money lost. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less than 10-2.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ **N** ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ **pricei**, **quantityi** ≤ 100 for each valid **i**
- 0 ≤ **discounti** ≤ 100 for each valid **i**

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (30 points):** 1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

</pre>
### Explanation

**Example case 1:** There are two recipes.

There are 5 recipes of the first type, each of them has a price of 100 and there is a 10% discount provided on it. Therefore, Chef first increases the price of each recipe by 10%, from 100 to 110. After that, she decreases the price by 10%, which makes the final price 99. The amount of money lost for each unit is 1, thus losing 5 for recipes of the first type.

There is only one recipe of the second type, with price 100 and a 50% discount. Therefore, Chef increases the price of the recipe by 50% from 100 to 150 and after that, she decreases its price by 50% to make its final price 75. She loses 25 for this recipe.

Overall, the amount of money Chef loses is 30.
