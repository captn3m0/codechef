Here, people eat chocolates daily instead of normal food. There is only one shop near your home; this shop is closed on Sunday, but open on all other days of the week. You may buy <b>at most one<\/b> box of <b>N<\/b> chocolates from this shop on each day when it is open.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently, it's Monday, and you need to survive for the next <b>S<\/b> days (including the current day). You have to eat <b>K<\/b> chocolates everyday (including the current day) to survive. Do note that you are allowed to buy the a chocolate box and eat from it on the same day.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nCompute the minimum number of days on which you need to buy from the shop so that you can survive the next <b>S<\/b> days, or determine that it isn't possible to survive.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
