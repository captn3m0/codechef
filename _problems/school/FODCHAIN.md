### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/russian/FODCHAIN.pdf) and [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/mandarin/FODCHAIN.pdf).

A great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level are consumed by the next level. 

Suppose in Chefland the energy reduces by a factor of $K$, i.e, if initially, the energy is $X$, then the transfer of energy to the next tropic level is $\lfloor \frac{X} {K} \rfloor$. This limits the length of foodchain which is defined to be the highest level receiving non-zero energy.

$E$ is the energy at the lowest tropic level. Given $E$ and $K$ for an ecosystem, find the maximum length of foodchain.

**Note:** $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denoted the floor function, and it returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$ (i.e  rounds down to the nearest integer). For example, $\lfloor 1.4 \rfloor = 1$, $\lfloor 5 \rfloor = 5$, $\lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2$, $\lfloor -3 \rfloor = -3$ , $\lfloor 0 \rfloor = 0$.
