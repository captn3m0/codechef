This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq X,Y \\leq 100$\n- $0 \\leq P,Q \\leq 100$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Chef and Chefina are competing against each other in a programming contest. They were both able to solve all the problems in the contest, so the winner between them must be decided by time penalty.

Who won the competition (or was it a draw)?\n\n**Note:** The time penalty is calculated as follows:\n- The base time penalty is the time at which the final problem was solved (so, $X$ for Chef and $Y$ for Chefina)\n- Each wrong submission adds a penalty of $10$ minutes\n- The winner is the person with less penalty time. If they both have the same penalty, it is considered a draw.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
