The description of <b>T<\/b> test cases follows.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe first line of each test case contains four distinct strings, denoting ingredients needed for the first dish.\nEach ingredient is represented by a string of length between 2 and 10 inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>The second line of each test case describes the second dish in the same format.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer \u2014 \"similar\" if at least half of the ingredients are same, and \"dissimilar\" otherwise (without the quotes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264\u00a0<b>T<\/b> \u2264 200<\/li>\n<li>The length of each string will be between 2 and 10 inclusive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n5\neggs sugar flour salt\nsugar eggs milk flour\naa ab ac ad\nac ad ae af\ncookies sugar grass lemon\nlemon meat chili wood\none two three four\none two three four\ngibberish jibberish lalalalala popopopopo\njibberisz gibberisz popopopopu lalalalalu\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nsimilar\nsimilar\ndissimilar\nsimilar\ndissimilar\n<\/pre>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n\n<p><b>Test case 1.<\/b> The first dish consists of ingredients: eggs, sugar, flour, salt, while the second dish consists of: sugar, eggs, milk, flour. Three of four ingredients are present in both dishes (eggs, sugar, flour) so the two dishes are similar.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 2.<\/b> This example shows that strings in the input don't necessarily represent real food.\nThe answer is again \"similar\", because two ingredients are present in both dishes (\"ac\" and \"ad\").<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 3.<\/b> The only common ingredient is lemon, so the answer is \"dissimilar\".\nRemember that at least two ingredients should be present in both dishes.<\/p>","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PERL6, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYPY, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM chicken, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"errichto","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>errichto<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"4-04-2017","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/april17'>\n                    april17\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/errichto'>\n                    errichto\n                <\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/SIMDISH","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1492421400,"submit_start_date":1492421400,"visible_start_date":1492421400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1497283938},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}
