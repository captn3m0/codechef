There are $N$ people participating in a race. The $N^{th}$ participant is your friend, so you want him to win. You are not a man of ethics, so you decided to inject some units of a Performance Enhancement Drug (don't ask where that came from) in your friend's body.

- From the charts, you came to know the speed of every player. Formally, for a player $i$, his speed is denoted by $S_i$. 
- The change in speed with one unit of the drug is $K$ units. Note that $K$ can be negative, which means the drug has more side effects than benefits.
- Of course, there will be a drug test before the race, so your friend will be caught if the number of units of the drug in his blood is greater than or equal to $L$.

You need to determine whether you can help your friend to win the race (with or without drugs), without getting caught.

**Note:** A player wins the race if he has the maximum speed among all the participants. If there are more than one people with a maximal speed, they tie at first place, and **no one** wins!
