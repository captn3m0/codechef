Ujan is a software developer. He is developing a software that takes two integers $L$ and $R$ and outputs the count of integers in the sequence $L,L+1,\ldots,R-1,R$ whose sum of digits (SOD) is divisible by $3$. 

He has developed the user interface (UI) quite easily. He is having a hard time finding the logic to solve the problem. As you are not only a good friend of Ujan but also a good problem solver, he asks you to help him out.

Can you solve the problem for your friend, Ujan?
