Three numbers have frequency $2$, while $2$ numbers have frequency $1$. Thus, the mode of the frequencies is $2$.\r\n\r\n- **Test case 2:** $(2$, $9$ and $5)$ have frequency $2$, while $(3$, $1$ and $7)$ have frequency $1$. Three numbers have frequency $2$, and $3$ numbers have frequency $1$. Since there are two modal values $1$ and $2$, we report the smaller one: $1$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME87\/mandarin\/MODEFREQ.pdf) and [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME87\/russian\/MODEFREQ.pdf).\r\n\r\nChef opted for Bio-Statistics as an Open-Elective course in his university, but soon got bored, and decided to text his friends during lectures.
