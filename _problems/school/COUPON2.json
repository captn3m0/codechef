He'll also order once tomorrow, when he'll buy three items costing $B_1, B_2$ and $B_3$ rupees, respectively. There is an additional delivery charge of rupees $D$ for each order.\r\n\r\nHe notices that there is a coupon on sale, which costs rupees $C$. If he buys that coupon, the delivery charges on any day, on an order of rupees $150$ or more shall be waived (that is, the $D$ rupees will not be added, if the sum of the costs of the items is $\\ge 150$). \r\n\r\nNote that Chef is ordering the three items together on each day, so the delivery charge is charged only once each day. Also, note that it's only needed to buy the coupon once to avail the delivery fee waiver on both days.\r\n\r\nShould Chef buy the coupon? Note that Chef shall buy the coupon only if it costs him **strictly less** than what it costs him without the coupon, in total.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. \r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $D$ and $C$, denoting the delivery charge, and the price of the coupon, respectively.\r\n- The second line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $A_1, A_2$ and $A_3$, denoting the prices of the food items that Chef plans to order on Day $1$, respectively.\r\n- The third line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$, denoting the prices of the food items that Chef plans to order on Day $2$, respectively.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\nFor each test case, output **YES** if Chef should buy the coupon, and **NO** otherwise, in a separate line.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^4$\r\n- $1 \\le D,C \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le  A_1, A_2, A_3  \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le B_1, B_2, B_3 \\le 100$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input 1:\r\n```\r\n2\r\n90 100\r\n100 50 10\r\n80 80 80\r\n30 30\r\n100 100 100\r\n10 20 30\r\n```\r\n###Sample Output 1:\r\n```\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\n```\r\n###Explanation:\r\n**Testcase 1:** On the first day, Chef plans on ordering three food items, costing a total of rupees $(100+50+10)=160$.
