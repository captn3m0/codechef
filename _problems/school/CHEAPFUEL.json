This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 1000$\n- $0 \\leq X, Y, A, B \\leq 1000$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (100 points)**: Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/CHEAPFUEL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/CHEAPFUEL.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/CHEAPFUEL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/CHEAPFUEL.pdf) as well.\n\nThe current price of petrol is $X$ rupees, and the current price of diesel is $Y$ rupees. At the start of each month, the price of petrol increases by $A$ rupees and the price of diesel increases by $B$ rupees. \n\nChef is curious to know which fuel costs less at the end of the $K^{th}$ month. If petrol is cheaper than diesel at the end of $K^{th}$ month, then print $\\verb+PETROL+$. If diesel is cheaper than petrol at the end of the $K^{th}$ month, then print $\\verb+DIESEL+$. If both the fuels have the same price at the end of the $K^{th}$ month, then print $\\verb+SAME PRICE+$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.

Since $A = 1$ and $B = 1$, the prices of both petrol and diesel increase by $1$ rupee at the start of every month. So, at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $1 + 1 = 2$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $1 + 1 = 2$ rupees. By the end of the first month, the price of petrol and diesel are both $2$ rupees and hence they both have the same price.\n\n**Test case 2:**\n\nInitially, the price of petrol is $2$ rupees and the price of diesel is $1$ rupee. Since $A = 2$ and $B = 1$, the price of petrol increases by $2$ rupee and the price of diesel increases by $1$ rupee at the start of every month. It follows that at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $2 + 2 = 4$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $1 + 1 = 2$ rupees. And by the start of the second month, the price of petrol becomes $4 + 2 = 6$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $2 + 1 = 3$ rupees. By the end of the second month, the prices of petrol and diesel are $6$ rupees and $3$ rupees respectively and hence diesel is cheaper than petrol.\n\n**Test case 3:**\n\nInitially, the price of petrol is $2$ rupee and the price of diesel is $2$ rupee. Since $A = 1$ and $B = 1$, the price of petrol increases by $1$ rupee and the price of diesel increases by $1$ rupee at the start of every month. It follows that at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $2 + 1 = 3$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $2 + 1 = 3$ rupees. And by the start of the second month, the price of petrol becomes $3 + 1 = 4$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $3 + 1 = 4$ rupees. By the end of the second month, the prices of petrol and diesel are both $4$ rupees and hence both have the same prices.","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KhwOUfGvTrk","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"0.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"suryaprak_adm","problem_author_html_handle":"suryaprak_adm","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"3-11-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/nov21'>nov21<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/suryaprak_adm'>suryaprak_adm<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CHEAPFUEL","time":{"view_start_date":1636968600,"submit_start_date":1636968600,"visible_start_date":1636968600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797709},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=CHEAPFUEL","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
