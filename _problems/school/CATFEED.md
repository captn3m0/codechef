### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/hindi/CATFEED.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/bengali/CATFEED.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/mandarin/CATFEED.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/russian/CATFEED.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/vietnamese/CATFEED.pdf) as well.

Chef owns $N$ cats (numbered $1$ through $N$) and he wants to feed them. There are $M$ identical cans of cat food; each can must be used to feed exactly one cat and Chef can only feed one cat at a time. Chef wrote down the order in which he wants to feed the cats: a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_M$.

An order of feeding cats is *fair* if there is no moment where Chef feeds a cat that has already been fed strictly more times than some other cat. Help Chef â€” tell him if the order in which he wants to feed the cats is fair.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. 
- The second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_M$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"YES"` if the order is fair or `"NO"` if it is unfair.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le M \le 10^3$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
7
3 9
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
3 9
1 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3
3 5

2 8
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1
5 3
5 3 1
4 5
1 2 3 1 4
```

### Example Output
```
YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
```
### Explanation
**Example case 4:** Cat $1$ will eat twice before cat $3$ eats even once, so the order is unfair.

**Example case 5:** The order is unfair because cat $1$ will eat its fifth can before cat $2$ eats its fourth can.

**Example case 7:** The order is unfair because cat $1$ will eat twice before cat $4$ eats even once.
