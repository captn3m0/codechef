He can give the commands \"start\", \"restart\" or \"stop\" to the service, the functionalities of which are specified below.\r\n\r\n- \"start\": Start the service.\r\n- \"restart\": If the service is started, do nothing. Otherwise, start the service.\r\n- \"stop\": If the service is not running, give an error. Otherwise, stop the service.\r\n\r\nThe service is initially not running. You are given $n$ commands that he then gives to the program in sequence. Your task is to identify whether some error\/s were encountered while running these commands.\r\n\r\n###Input\r\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$, denoting the number of commands.\r\n- The next line contains $n$ space separated strings, each of which is either \"start\", \"restart\" or \"stop\".\r\n\r\n###Output\r\nFor each test case, output \"404\" if some error occurred, otherwise output \"200\" (without quotes).\r\n\r\n###Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le n \\le 10$\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n5\r\n2\r\nstart stop\r\n2\r\nrestart stop\r\n3\r\nstart restart stop\r\n3\r\nstart stop stop\r\n1\r\nstop\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\n200\r\n200\r\n200\r\n404\r\n404\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n- In the first, second and third cases, there won't be any error.\r\n- In the fourth case, when you execute the third command, the service is already stopped.
