He decided to automate the interview process to save time. The server asks $N$ problems to the interviewee and stores the amount of time a candidate takes to solve each problem. More formally, the data is stored as an array $A$, where the $i$-th integer $A_i$ denotes the time (in seconds) the candidate took to solve the $i$-th problem.    \r\nNote that $A_i$ = $-1$ denotes that the candidate was not able to solve the $i$-th problem at all. Can you help Ashish automate the process by writing a code to find the verdict of the interview?\r\n\r\nThe verdict can be one of the following: \r\n- **Rejected:** If the number of problems that the candidate solved is strictly less than $ceil(N\/2)$.      \r\n- **Too Slow:** If candidate is not **Rejected** and candidate took more than $K$ seconds to solve at least one problem among the problems solved by the candidate.        \r\n- **Bot:**  If candidate is neither **Rejected** nor **Too Slow**, but has solved all of the $N$ problems in at most one second each.          \r\n- **Accepted:** If the candidate is neither **Rejected**, **Too Slow**, nor **Bot**, she is **Accepted**.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers - $N$ and $K$ respectively.    \r\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers - $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$. \r\n\r\n### Output\r\n- For each testcase, output a single line containing the verdict of the interview.    \r\n- The judge is **case-insensitive** so if the answer is **Accepted** then any one of **accepted**, **aCCepted**, **ACCEPTED**, etc will be considered as a correct answer.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\r\n- $6 \\leq N \\leq 100$\r\n- $30 \\leq K \\leq 60$\r\n- $-1 \\leq A_i \\leq 120$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n- 100% points - Original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n5\r\n7 30\r\n-1 0 4 -1 -1 40 -1\r\n6 30\r\n1 0 1 1 1 0\r\n6 44\r\n1 1 1 1 -1 0\r\n7 31\r\n2 3 42 -1 -1 -1 4\r\n6 60\r\n1 -1 0 60 -1 -1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\nRejected\r\nBot\r\nAccepted\r\nToo Slow\r\nAccepted\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n- **Example case 1:** There are $N=7$ problems but candidate was able to solve only $3$ of them which is less than $ceil(N\/2)$ and hence the verdict is **Rejected**.\r\n\r\n- **Example case 2:** The candidate solved all the problems and took at most $1$ second to answer each one of them. Hence the verdict is **Bot**.\r\n\r\n- **Example case 3:** The candidate solved $5$ out of $N=6$ problems. The verdict is not **Too Slow** as $K=44$. The verdict is also not **Bot** because candidate couldn't solve all of the $N=6$ problems. Hence the verdict is **Accepted**.\r\n\r\n- **Example case 4:** The candidate solved $4$ out of $N=7$ problems but took $42$ seconds to answer the $3$-rd problem which is more more than $K=31$.
