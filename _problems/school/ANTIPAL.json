This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- The sum of $N$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Chef just had a big argument with his best friend.

He would like it to be as far from a palindrome as possible, and so he would like $S$ to satisfy the following condition:\n\n- Let $T$ be the reverse of $S$. Then, $S_i \\neq T_i$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.\n\nCan you help Chef construct $S$?\nIf there are multiple possible strings that satisfy Chef's condition, you may print **any** of them.\n\n**Note 1:** A string $S$ is said to be a binary string if every character of $S$ is either `'0'` or `'1'`.\n\n**Note 2:** Let $S$ be a string of length $N$. String $T$ is said to be its reverse if $T_i = S_{N+1-i}$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq N$. For example, the reverse of $10010$ is $01001$ and the reverse of $0110$ is $0110$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
