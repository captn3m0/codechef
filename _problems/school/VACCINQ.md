There are $N$ people in the vaccination queue, Chef is standing on the $P^{th}$ position from the front of the queue. It takes $X$ minutes to vaccinate a child and $Y$ minutes to vaccinate an elderly person. Assume Chef is an elderly person.


You are given a binary array $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ of length $N$, where $A_i = 1$ denotes there is an elderly person standing on the $i^{th}$ position of the queue, $A_i = 0$ denotes there is a child standing on the $i^{th}$ position of the queue. You are also given the three integers $P, X, Y$. Find the number of minutes after which Chef's vaccination will be completed.
