Moreover, he can duck by $Y_{1}$ units and jump by height $Y_{2}$ units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier $1$ till the barrier $N$. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier.
