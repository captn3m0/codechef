{"category_name":"school","status":"success","problem_code":"CCISLAND","problem_name":"Chef On Island","body":"Suppose Chef is stuck on an island and currently he has $x$ units of food supply and $y$ units of water supply in total that he could collect from the island. He needs $x_r$ units of food supply and $y_r$ units of water supply per day at the minimal to have sufficient energy to build a boat from the woods and also to live for another day. Assuming it takes exactly $D$ days to build the boat and reach the shore, tell whether Chef has the sufficient amount of supplies to be able to reach the shore by building the boat?\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.
