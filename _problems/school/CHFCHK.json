Once, it realised that it was on an infinitely long road, and decided to travel along this road by jumping.\r\n\r\nLet's view the road as the $x$-axis in a 1D coordinate system. Initially, Chef Chick is at the coordinate $x=0$, and it wants to move only in the positive $x$-direction. Moreover, Chef Chick has $N$ favourite integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N$, and it wants to jump on the coordinates that are multiples of these favourite numbers \u2014 when its current position is $x$, it jumps to the smallest coordinate $y \\gt x$ such that $y$ is an integer multiple of at least one of the values $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N$; the length of such a jump is $y-x$.\r\n\r\nThis way, Chef Chick keeps jumping along the road forever in the positive $x$-direction. You need to find the length of the longest jump it will make, i.e. the largest integer $d$ such that Chef Chick makes at least one jump with length $d$ and never makes any jump with a greater length. It can be proved that such an integer always exists.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the length of the longest jump that Chick will make.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N$ are pairwise distinct\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** The sequence of coordinates on which Chef Chick would jump starts with $(0, 2, 3, 4, 6, \\ldots)$. A longest jump is e.g. from $4$ to $6$, with length $2$.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK114\/hindi\/CHFCHK.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK114\/mandarin\/CHFCHK.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK114\/russian\/CHFCHK.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK114\/vietnamese\/CHFCHK.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK114\/bengali\/CHFCHK.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nChef Chick loves to jump a lot.
