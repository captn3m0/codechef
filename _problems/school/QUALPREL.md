Snackdown 2019 is coming! There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the $K=1500$-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than $K$ qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the $K$-th place).

Today, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of $K$ (possibly different from $1500$). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the $K$-th team qualify.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of qualified teams.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le S_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Example Input
```

5 1
3 5 2 4 5
6 4
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Example Output
