### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME82/hindi/SWPDGT.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME82/bengali/SWPDGT.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME82/mandarin/SWPDGT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME82/russian/SWPDGT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME82/vietnamese/SWPDGT.pdf) as well.

Chef has two positive integers $A$ and $B$. He can tamper with them by choosing a digit in the decimal representation of $A$ and a digit in the decimal representation of $B$ and swapping these digits. This operation may be performed at most once.

Find the maximum possible sum of the resulting numbers which Chef can obtain. 

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum sum.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le A, B \le 99$

### Example Input
```
3
13 82
9 24
20 30
```

### Example Output
```
104
96
50
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Swapping the digits $1$ (from $13$) and $2$ (from $82$) gives us $23$ and $81$. Their sum $23+81 = 104$ is the maximum possible sum.

**Example case 3:** Swapping is not needed as the original numbers have the maximum possible sum.
