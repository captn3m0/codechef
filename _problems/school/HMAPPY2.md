<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>### Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB19TST/hindi/HMAPPY2.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB19TST/bengali/HMAPPY2.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB19TST/mandarin/HMAPPY2.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB19TST/russian/HMAPPY2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB19TST/vietnamese/HMAPPY2.pdf) as well.

Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are $N$ problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between $1$ and $N$ inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them â€• Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by $A$ but not divisible by $B$, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by $B$ but not divisible by $A$ (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both $A$ and $B$).

To win, it is necessary to solve at least $K$ problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $A$, $B$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"Win"` if they can solve at least $K$ problems or `"Lose"` otherwise (without quotes).

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 15$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):**
- $1 \le T \le 15$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^6$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (85 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
6 2 3 3
```

### Example Output
```
Win
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Appy is solving the problems with codes $2$ and $4$, Chef is solving the problem with code $3$. Nobody is solving problem $6$, since $6$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Therefore, they can solve $3$ problems and win.
