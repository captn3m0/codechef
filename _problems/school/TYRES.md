### Read problems statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/russian/TYRES.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/bengali/TYRES.pdf).

Chef opened a company which manufactures cars and bikes. Each car requires $4$ tyres while each bike requires $2$ tyres. Chef has a total of $N$ tyres ($N$ is even). He wants to manufacture maximum number of cars from these tyres and then manufacture bikes from the remaining tyres.

Chef's friend went to Chef to purchase a bike. If Chef's company has manufactured even a single bike then Chef's friend will be able to purchase it.

Determine whether he will be able to purchase the bike or not.
