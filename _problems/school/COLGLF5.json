At $T = 1$ there is an important event in football match and since we are already watching the same channel we won't switch. At $T = 2$,\r\nthere is an important event in cricket match and we switch the channel for the first time. At $T = 3$, there is an important event in football match and we switch the channel for the second time. At $T = 4$, there is an important event in cricket match and we switch the channel for the third time. So in total we switch three times.\r\n\r\n**Case 2:** At $T = 0$, we are watching El Clasico. At $T = 1$ there is an important event in cricket match and we switch the channel for the first time. At $T = 100$, there is an important event in football match and we switch the channel for the second time. At $T = 200$, there is an important event in football match and since we are on the same channel, we don't switch. At $T = 300$, there is an important event in football match and since we are on the same channel, we don't switch. So in total we switch two times.\r\n\r\n**Case 3:** At $T = 0$, we are watching El Clasico. At $T = 1$ there is an important event in football match and since we are on the same channel, we don't switch. At $T = 100$, there is an important event in cricket match and we switch the channel for the first time. At $T = 200$, there is an important event in cricket match and since we are on the same channel, we don't switch. So in total we switch only one time.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"There is only $1$ TV in the common room, and as luck would have it, both the El Clasico football match and the India-Pakistan cricket match are happening simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThere is one football fan who is looking at the live commentary online and will scream whenever an 'important' event takes place in the El Clasico.
