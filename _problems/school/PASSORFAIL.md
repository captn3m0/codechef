Chef is struggling to pass a certain college course.

The test has a total of $N$ question, each question carries $3$ marks for a correct answer and $-1$ for an incorrect answer. Chef is a risk-averse person so he decided to attempt all the questions. It is known that Chef got $X$ questions correct and the rest of them incorrect. For Chef to pass the course he must score at least $P$ marks. 

Will Chef be able to pass the exam or not?
