{"category_name":"school","status":"success","problem_code":"USANBOLT","problem_name":"Usain Bolt vs Tiger","body":"Back in 2015, Usain Bolt announced that he'll be retiring after the 2017 World Championship. Though his final season did not end gloriously, we all know that he is a true legend and we witnessed his peak during 2008 - 2013. \r\n\r\nPost retirement, Usain Bolt is still leading an adventurous life. He's exploring the unexplored parts of the globe. But sometimes he gets bored, and reads questions asked about him on Quora. One such question he read was, \"Who would win a race between Usain Bolt and a tiger if the race is on a straight line track and the tiger is $distancetoBolt$ meters behind Bolt? The finishing point is $finish$ meters away from Bolt's starting position. The tiger starts with an initial speed of $0$  $meter\/second$, and will accelerate itself with $tigerAccelaration$  $m\/s^2$. Bolt can run with a constant speed of $boltSpeed$  $m\/s$ from start to finish. Given these values, find out who will win the race - Bolt or the tiger? \"\r\n\r\nNote that Bolt will win the race if and only if he touches the finishing line before the tiger touches it. If both of them finish together, the tiger is announced as the winner since Bolt was given an initial advantage.
