<p>Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to <i>find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.</i> More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
1
2
88
42
99

<b>Output:</b>
1
2
88
</pre>
