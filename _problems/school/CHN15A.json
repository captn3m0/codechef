Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier \u2014 a machine which mutates minions.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nEach minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer <b>K<\/b> to each of the minions' characteristic value. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nGru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nGiven the initial characteristic integers of <b>N<\/b> minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input Format:<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains one integer, <b>T<\/b>, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.<\/p>\n<p>The first line contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>K<\/b>, as described in the statement.<\/p>\n<p>The next line contains <b>N<\/b> integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output Format:<\/h3>\n<p>For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 K \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<li>All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 10<sup>5<\/sup>, both inclusive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n5 10\n2 4 1 35 1\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:<\/h3>\nAfter transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"arjunarul","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #1E7D22;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>2&#9733;<\/span><span>arjunarul<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":null,"date_added":"26-10-2015","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/acmchn15'>acmchn15<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/arjunarul'>arjunarul<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/modulo'>modulo<\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CHN15A","time":{"view_start_date":1420050600,"submit_start_date":1420050600,"visible_start_date":1420050600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1528985554},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
