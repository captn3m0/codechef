This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1.6 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq x_k, y_k, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\leq 8$\n- Initially the king is not under check, i.e, $x_k \\neq x_1$ and $x_k \\neq x_2$ and $y_k \\neq y_1$ and $y_k \\neq y_2$.\n- No two pieces overlap.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask #1 (100 points):** Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"You are given a standard $8 \\times 8$ chessboard which has exactly $3$ pieces placed on it - $2$ black rooks and $1$ white king. The rows are numbered $1$ to $8$ from bottom to top, and the columns are numbered $1$ to $8$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the $i$-th column and $j$-th row is denoted $(i, j)$ (like the coordinate system on the $xy$-plane).\n\nIs it possible for the white king to be checkmated by the rooks in exactly one move? It is guaranteed that the initial position of pieces is such that the white king is **not under check.**\n\nNote that in the given situation, **black moves first**.\n\nAssume that all the chess rules are to be followed:\n- Each square can contain at most one piece.\n- Rooks can only travel in straight lines along the row or column they are placed at, and can't jump over other pieces.\n- The King can move to any of its $8$ adjacent squares.\n- A piece can't capture a piece of the same color as itself.\n- After a black makes a move, the white king can capture a rook if it's present on any of the $8$ adjacent squares and not protected by the other rook.\n- The king is said to be in [checkmate](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Checkmate) **if the king is currently under check** and **there exists no legal move with the king to escape from the check**.\n- [Stalemate](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stalemate) is considered as a draw for both sides.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the moves of pieces, along with images, please [click here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chess#Movement). \n\n**Note**: The input and output are large, so use fast input-output methods.\n- In C++, either use `printf` and `scanf`, or add the line `ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` to the beginning of `main` to speed up `cin` and `cout`.
