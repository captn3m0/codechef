### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/bengali/PROBDIFF.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/mandarin/PROBDIFF.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/russian/PROBDIFF.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/vietnamese/PROBDIFF.pdf) as well.

You have prepared four problems. The difficulty levels of the problems are $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ respectively. A problem set comprises at least two problems and no two problems in a problem set should have the same difficulty level. A problem can belong to at most one problem set. Find the maximum number of problem sets you can create using the four problems.
