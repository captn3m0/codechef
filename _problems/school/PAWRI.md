### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/mandarin/PAWRI.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/russian/PAWRI.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/vietnamese/PAWRI.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK127/bengali/PAWRI.pdf) as well.

Lately, Chef has been inspired by the "pawri" meme. Therefore, he decided to take a string $S$ and change each of its substrings that spells "party" to "pawri". Find the resulting string.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string after it is modified by Chef.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters

### Example Input
```
3
part
partypartiparty
yemaihuyemericarhaiauryahapartyhorahihai
```

### Example Output
```
part
pawripartipawri
yemaihuyemericarhaiauryahapawrihorahihai
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There is no substring "party" in the original string.

**Example case 2:** The original string has $2$ substrings "party".

**Example case 3:** There is only a single substring "party" in the original string.
