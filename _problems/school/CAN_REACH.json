This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 600$\n- $-1000 \\leq x, y \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 1000$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"A first-year student, came to your college. Being a good senior, you must tell him if it is possible to go from College Main Gate to Hostel for him.\n\nThe college can be visualized on a 2D-plane. Suppose the College Main Gate is situated at origin i.e. at the coordinates $(0, 0)$ and the Hostel is situated at the coordinates $(x,y)$.\n\nAs the first-year student wants to explore the college campus further, in one move, he will increase or decrease any coordinate (either the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate) by a value of **exactly** $K$.\n\nIs it possible for the first-year student to reach the Hostel?","inputFormat":"- First line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
