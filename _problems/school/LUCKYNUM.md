Chef buys a lottery ticket that has a $3$ digit code associated with it. He thinks that digit $7$ is his lucky digit and brings him good luck. Chef will win some amount in the lottery if at least one of the digits of the lottery ticket is $7$.

Given three digits $A$, $B$, and $C$ of the lottery ticket, tell whether Chef wins something or not?
