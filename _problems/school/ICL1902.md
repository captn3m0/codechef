In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with $N$ Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side $S$ requires $S^2$ Circles to create.
 
 Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.
 
###Input:
 
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$.
 
###Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.
 
###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
 
###Sample Input:
2           
85          
114          

###Sample Output:
2               
4
               
###EXPLANATION:
Test case 1 : Mr Sphere forms a square of side 9 using 81 Circles and then forms a square of side 2 using the remaining 4.
