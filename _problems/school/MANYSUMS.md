### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/hindi/MANYSUMS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/mandarin/MANYSUMS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/russian/MANYSUMS.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/vietnamese/MANYSUMS.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/bengali/MANYSUMS.pdf) as well.

You are given a range of integers $\{L, L+1, \ldots, R\}$. An integer $X$ is said to be *reachable* if it can be represented as a sum of two **not necessarily distinct** integers in this range. Find the number of distinct reachable integers.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of reachable integers.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq L \leq R \leq 10^6$

### Example Input
```
2
2 2
2 3
```

### Example Output
```
1
3
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The only reachable integer is $2 + 2 = 4$.

**Example case 2:** $4$, $5$ and $6$ are reachable, since $2+2=4$, $2+3=5$ and $3+3=6$.
