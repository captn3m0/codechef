Darth has a peculiar fighting style \u2015 he does not attack, but simply defends and lets his opponent tire himself out.\r\n\r\nChef has a lightsaber which has an *attack power* denoted by $P$. He keeps hitting Darth with the lightsaber. Every time he hits, Darth's health decreases by the current attack power of the lightsaber (by $P$ points), and afterwards, $P$ decreases to $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{P}{2} \\right\\rfloor$.\r\n\r\nIf the attack power becomes $0$ before Darth's health becomes $0$ or less, Chef dies.
