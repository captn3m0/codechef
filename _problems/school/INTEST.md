<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the <b>enormous Input/Output</b> warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=10<sup>7</sup>). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer t<sub>i</sub>, not greater than 10<sup>9</sup>, each.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers t<sub>i</sub> are divisible by k.

<h3>Example</h3>
