### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/russian/PENALTY.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/mandarin/PENALTY.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/bengali/PENALTY.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/vietnamese/PENALTY.pdf) as well.

It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shotouts. 
Each team is given $5$ shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game. If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have $2$ champions.

Given ten integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{10}$, where the odd indexed integers($A_1, A_3,$ $A_5,$ $A_7, A_9$) represent the outcome of the shots made by team $1$ and even indexed integers($A_2, A_4, A_6, A_8, A_{10}$) represent the outcome of the shots made by team $2$ (here $A_i = 1$ indicates that it's a goal and $A_i = 0$ indicates a miss), determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.
