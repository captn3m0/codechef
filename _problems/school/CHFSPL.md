### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/CHFSPL.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/CHFSPL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/CHFSPL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/CHFSPL.pdf) as well.

Chef has three spells. Their powers are $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. Initially, Chef has $0$ hit points, and if he uses a spell with power $P$, then his number of hit points increases by $P$.

Before going to sleep, Chef wants to use exactly two spells out of these three. Find the maximum number of hit points Chef can have after using the spells.
