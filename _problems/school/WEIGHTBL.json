This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was $w_1$ kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after $M$ months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was $w_2$ kg ($w_2 \\gt w_1$).\r\n\r\nScientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between $x_1$ and $x_2$ kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month.
