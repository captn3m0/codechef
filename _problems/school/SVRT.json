You wish to place $K$ servers in some distinct locations from among $N$ locations. The locations, numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, N$ are arranged in a circular manner. The distance between every adjacent location is 1 unit. $1$ and $N$ are adjacent. \r\n\r\nYou want to place the servers such that the maximum shortest distance between any two adjacent servers is as less as possible.

We can place the servers at locations $1$, $3$ and $5$. Thus, the distances between locations $1$ and $3$, $3$ and $5$, and $5$ and $1$ are all $=2$, which is the lowest possible maximum distance that can be achieved here. There are $3$ pairs of locations separated by this distance.\r\n\r\n- **Sample Test $2$:** Let the locations be numbered from $1$ to $10$. We can place the servers at locations $1,2,4,6,8$ and $10$. Thus, the minimum possible maximum distance between any two adjacent servers is $2$. There shall be at least $4$ pairs of servers separated by this distance. Here, they are $(2,4)$, $(4,6)$, $(6,8)$ and $(8,10)$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You are the Chief Engineer of a fast growing start-up.
