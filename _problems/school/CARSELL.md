Chef owns $N$ cars (numbered $1$ through $N$). He wishes to sell all of them over $N$ years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid $i$, the initial price of the $i$-th car is $P_i$. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by $1$ unit per year until it is sold.

Note that the price of a car cannot drop below $0$ no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches $0$ in some year, it remains $0$ in all subsequent years.

Find the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9+7$).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum profit Chef can make, modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 25$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le P_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $N \le 2 \cdot 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
3
6 6 6

0 1 0
```

### Example Output
```
15
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- During the first year, Chef's profit so far is $0$ and the prices of the cars are $[6,6,6]$. Chef sells one of these cars.
- During the second year, Chef's profit so far is $6$ and the prices of the remaining cars are $[5,5]$. Again, Chef sells one of these cars.
- During the third year, Chef's profit so far is $11$ and there is one car with price $4$. Chef sells this car.
- In the fourth year, Chef has sold all of his cars and his profit is $15$. This is the maximum profit he can make. 

**Example case 2:**
- During the first year, Chef's profit so far is $0$ and the prices of the cars are $[0,1,0]$. Chef sells the second car.
- During the second year, Chef's profit so far is $1$ and the prices of the remaining cars are $[0,0]$. Chef sells one of these cars.
- During the third year, Chef's profit so far is $1$ and there is one car with price $0$. Chef sells this car.
- During the fourth year, Chef has sold all his cars and his profit is $1$.
