In the store, they offer $N$ cans of coke (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the current temperature of the $i$-th can is $C_i$ and its price is $P_i$.\n\nAfter buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef $M$ minutes to get home from the store.\n\nThe ambient temperature outside is $K$. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is $t$ at some point in time:\n- if $t \\gt K+1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $t-1$\n- if $t \\lt K-1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $t+1$\n- if $K-1 \\le t \\le K+1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $K$\n\nWhen Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive). Find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied or determine that there is no such can.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ and $R$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $C_i$ and $P_i$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the price of the can Chef should buy, or $-1$ if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le M \\le 100$\n- $|C_i| \\le 50$ for each valid $i$\n- $|K| \\le 50$\n- $-50 \\le L \\le R \\le 50$\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 10^6$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n3 2 5 4 6\n1 6\n2 8\n8 10\n3 5 10 20 30\n21 20\n22 22\n23 23\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n8\n-1\n```\n\t\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** Chef should buy the second can (with price $8$), even though the first can is cheaper. If Chef bought the first can, its temperature would be $3$ when he got home, and that is outside the range $[4, 6]$.\n\n**Example case 2:** No matter which can Chef buys, when he gets home, its temperature will be less than $20$, so there is no suitable can available in the store.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK109\/hindi\/COKE.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK109\/mandarin\/COKE.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK109\/russian\/COKE.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK109\/vietnamese\/COKE.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK109\/bengali\/COKE.pdf) as well.\n\nChef went to the store in order to buy one can of coke.
