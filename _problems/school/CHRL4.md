All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME08/russian/CHRL4.pdf) also.

After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the **N**-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the **X**-th street to the **Y**-th street if and only if 1 &lt;= **Y** - **X** &lt;= **K**, where **K** is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the **N**-th street). Please, help him to find such a product.

### Input

The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - **N** and **K** - the number of streets and the value of **K** respectively. The second line consist of **N** numbers - **A1**, **A2**, ..., **AN** respectively, where **Ai** equals to the special number of the **i**-th street.

### Output

Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo **1000000007**.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **10^5**
- **1** ≤ **Ai** ≤ **10^5**
- **1** ≤ **K** ≤ **N**

### Example

### Scoring

Subtask 1 (30 points): **N** &lt;= 80 

Subtask 2 (70 points): See the constraints.
