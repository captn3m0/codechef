### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE20/hindi/XYSTR.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE20/bengali/XYSTR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE20/mandarin/XYSTR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE20/russian/XYSTR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE20/vietnamese/XYSTR.pdf) as well.

There are $N$ students standing in a row and numbered $1$ through $N$ from left to right. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$, where for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is 'x' if the $i$-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.

The students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of pairs.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $|S| = N$
- $S$ contains only characters 'x' and 'y'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
xy
xyxxy
yy
```

### Example Output
```
1
2
0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There is only one possible pair: (first student, second student).

**Example case 2:** One of the ways to form two pairs is: (first student, second student) and (fourth student, fifth student). 

Another way to form two pairs is: (second student, third student) and (fourth student, fifth student).
