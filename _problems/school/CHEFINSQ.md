### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/hindi/CHEFINSQ.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/bengali/CHEFINSQ.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/mandarin/CHEFINSQ.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/russian/CHEFINSQ.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/vietnamese/CHEFINSQ.pdf) as well.

Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. This sequence has exactly $2^N$ subsequences. Chef considers a subsequence of $A$ *interesting* if its size is exactly $K$ and the sum of all its elements is minimum possible, i.e. there is no subsequence with size $K$ which has a smaller sum.

Help Chef find the number of interesting subsequences of the sequence $A$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of interesting subsequences.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 50$
- $1 \le A_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le N \le 20$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4
```

### Example Output
```
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are six subsequences with length $2$: $(1, 2)$, $(1, 3)$, $(1, 4)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$ and $(3, 4)$. The minimum sum is $3$ and the only subsequence with this sum is $(1, 2)$.
