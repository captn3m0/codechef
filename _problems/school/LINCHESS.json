In this game, he has a pawn, which is initially at a square $K$. There are also $N$ other people (numbered $1$ through $N$); Chef can choose one of them to play against. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th player would play in the following way:\r\n- Take a pawn and place it on a square $P_i$.\r\n- Repeat the following move any number of times: move the pawn from its current square $P_i$ squares forward, i.e. from a square $s$, this player's pawn is moved to the square $s+P_i$.\r\n- If this player moves their pawn to the square with Chef's pawn, then Chef's pawn is *captured* and he loses the game.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Chef cannot move his pawn during the game, making him an easy target for other players. Given the starting positions of all $N+1$ players, find a player who can capture Chef's pawn in the smallest number of moves or determine that no player can capture his pawn.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the starting square of one player that can beat Chef in the smallest number of turns, or $-1$ if no player can beat him.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 1,000$\r\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$\r\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $K, P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$ are pairwise distinct\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n4 6\r\n4 3 2 8\r\n4 7\r\n4 3 2 8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n3\r\n-1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** The player who starts at the position $2$ can move to square $4$ and then to square $6$. The player who starts at the position $3$ can move to square $6$.
