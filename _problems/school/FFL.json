In FFL, each team consists of exactly $15$ players: $2$ *goalkeepers*, $5$ *defenders*, $5$ *midfielders* and $3$ *forwards*. Chef has already bought $13$ players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.\r\n\r\nThere are $N$ available players (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price $P_i$. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed $100$ dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him $S$ dollars.\r\n\r\nCan you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $S$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$.\r\n- The last line contains $N$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers is $0$ if the $i$-th player is a defender or $1$ if the $i$-th player is a forward.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string `\"yes\"` if it is possible to build a complete team or `\"no\"` otherwise (without quotes).\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\r\n- $13 \\le S \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n4 90\r\n3 8 6 5\r\n0 1 1 0\r\n4 90\r\n5 7 6 5\r\n0 1 1 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\nyes\r\nno\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** If Chef buys the $1$-st and $3$-rd player, the total price of his team is $90 + 9 = 99$, which is perfectly fine.
