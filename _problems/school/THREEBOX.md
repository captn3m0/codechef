### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/bengali/THREEBOX.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/mandarin/THREEBOX.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/russian/THREEBOX.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/vietnamese/THREEBOX.pdf) as well.

Chef has $3$ boxes of sizes $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. He puts the boxes in bags of size $D$ ($A \leq B \leq C \leq D$). Find the minimum number of bags Chef needs so that he can put each box in a bag. A bag can contain more than one box if the sum of sizes of boxes in the bag does not exceed the size of the bag.
