It's well known that our friend Balsa likes the digit $3$ very much. He's so obsessed with this digit that he spends time thinking about it even during holidays.

Today, Balsa invented an interesting problem: For a positive integer $N$, find the smallest integer greater than $N$ such that its decimal representation contains the digit $3$ at least three times.
 
You are given the integer $N$. Please solve this problem for Balsa.

### Input 
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the smallest number greater than $N$ containing the digit $3$ at least three times.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 40$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^9$

### Example Input
```
3
221
333
3002
```

### Example Output
```
333
1333
3033
```
