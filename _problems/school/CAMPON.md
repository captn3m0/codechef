The Petrozavodsk camp takes place in about one month. Jafar wants to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik.

Yalalovichik is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However, he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems on Timus. He started a marathon at the beginning of December. Initially, he said that people who solve 200 or more problems by the 31-st of December may go to the camp. Jafar made a schedule for the next month. For each day, he knows how many problems he is going to solve.

The problem is that Yalalovichik is a really moody coach â€” he may wake up tomorrow and change his decision about the deadline and the number of problems that must be solved by this deadline to qualify for the camp. Jafar has $Q$ such scenarios. Now he wants to know: in each scenario, if he does not change his problem solving schedule, will he go to the camp or not?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $D$ - the number of days in Jafar's schedule.
- $D$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le D$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $d_i$ and $p_i$ denoting that Jafar will solve $p_i$ problems on day $d_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of scenarios Jafar considers.
- $Q$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le Q$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $dead_i$ and $req_i$ denoting a scenario where Yalaovichik decides that students who solve $req_i$ problems by day $dead_i$ (inclusive) will go to the camp.

### Output
For each scenario, print a single line containing the string `"Go Camp"` if Jafar is going to the camp or `"Go Sleep"` otherwise (without quotes).

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le D \le 31$
- $1 \le d_i \le 31$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le p_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_D$ are pairwise distinct
- $1 \le Q \le 100$
- $1 \le dead_i \le 31$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le req_i \le 5,000$ for each valid $i$

### Example Input
```
1
3
10 5
14 4
31 1
2
9 2
15 7
```

### Example Output
```
Go Sleep
Go Camp
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- By the end of day $9$, Jafar will not have any problem solved.
- By the end of day $15$, Jafar will have $9$ problems solved, which is enough to go to the camp, since he needs at least $7$ problems.
