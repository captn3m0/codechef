Chef has an exam which will start exactly $M$ minutes from now. However, instead of preparing for his exam, Chef started watching Season-$1$ of Superchef. Season-$1$ has $N$ episodes, and the duration of **each** episode is $K$ minutes. 

Will Chef be able to finish watching Season-$1$ **strictly before** the exam starts?
