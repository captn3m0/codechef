Chef has decided to go to a gold mine along with $N$ of his friends (thus, total $N+1$ people including Chef go to the gold mine).

The gold mine contains a total of $X$ kg of gold. Every person has the capacity of carrying up $\textbf{atmost}$ $Y$ kg of gold.

Will Chef and his friends together be able to carry up all the gold from the gold mine assuming that they can go to the mine exactly once.
