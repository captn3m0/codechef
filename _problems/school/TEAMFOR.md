### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/TEAMFOR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/TEAMFOR.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/TEAMFOR.pdf) as well.

A programming competition will be held in Chef's city which only accepts teams of size $2$. At least one person in a team should know a programming language and at least one person should know about the English language. It is possible that one person in a team knows both programming and the English language. Then the qualification of the other teammate is not important i.e. he may or may not know programming and English. Now Chef has $N$ students and wants to send *maximum* number of teams to the competition.

You are given an integer $N$ and two binary strings $S$ and $T$ of length $N$. $S_i = $ `'1'` denotes that the $i^{th}$ student knows a programming language, and $S_i = $ `'0'` denotes otherwise; similarly, $T_i =$ `'1'` denotes that the $i^{th}$ student knows English language, and $T_i = $ `'0'` denotes otherwise. Determine the maximum number of teams Chef can form.
