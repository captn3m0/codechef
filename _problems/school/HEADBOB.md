All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME17/mandarin/HEADBOB.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME17/russian/HEADBOB.pdf).

Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.
When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis.
 There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the  *Indian head-bob*.

Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as "**Y**", no as "**N**" and Indian "Yes" gesture as "**I**". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.

### Input

First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.
Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".### Output

For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.### Constraints
