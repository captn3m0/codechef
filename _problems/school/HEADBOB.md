<p>Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.<br>When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis.<br> There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the <i> Indian head-bob</i>.</p><p>Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as "<b>Y</b>", no as "<b>N</b>" and Indian "Yes" gesture as "<b>I</b>". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.</p><h3>Input</h3>First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.<br>Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".<h3>Output</h3>For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.<h3>Constraints</h3><ul><pre><li><b>For 30 points: </b>1 ≤ T,N ≤ 100<li><b>For 70 points: </b>1 ≤ T,N ≤ 1000</ul></pre><h3>Example</h3><b>Input:</b><pre>3<br>5<br>NNNYY<br>6<br>NNINNI<br>4<br>NNNN<br></pre><br><b>Output:</b><pre>NOT INDIAN<br>INDIAN<br>NOT SURE</pre>
