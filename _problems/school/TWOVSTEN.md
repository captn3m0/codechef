Chef Two and Chef Ten are playing a game with a number $X$. In one turn, they can multiply $X$ by $2$. The goal of the game is to make $X$ divisible by $10$.

Help the Chefs find the smallest number of turns necessary to win the game (it may be possible to win in zero turns) or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer denoting the initial value of $X$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of turns or $-1$ if there is no way to win the game.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1000$
- $0 \le X \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```

1
```

### Example Output
```
