He wishes to sell all of them over $N$ years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid $i$, the initial price of the $i$-th car is $P_i$. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by $1$ unit per year until it is sold.\r\n\r\nNote that the price of a car cannot drop below $0$ no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches $0$ in some year, it remains $0$ in all subsequent years.\r\n\r\nFind the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way.

Chef sells this car.\r\n- In the fourth year, Chef has sold all of his cars and his profit is $15$. This is the maximum profit he can make. \r\n\r\n**Example case 2:**\r\n- During the first year, Chef's profit so far is $0$ and the prices of the cars are $[0,1,0]$. Chef sells the second car.\r\n- During the second year, Chef's profit so far is $1$ and the prices of the remaining cars are $[0,0]$. Chef sells one of these cars.\r\n- During the third year, Chef's profit so far is $1$ and there is one car with price $0$.
