Pile $A$ belongs to Chef and pile $B$ belongs to Morty.\r\n - Each card has one positive integer on it\r\n - The \u2018power\u2019 of a card is defined as the sum of digits of the integer on that card\r\n - The game consists of $N$ rounds\r\n - In each round, both players simultaneously draw one card each from the top of their piles and the player who draws the card with higher power wins this round and gets a point. If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get $1$ point each. \r\n - The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of $N$ rounds.
