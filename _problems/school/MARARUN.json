In order to claim the prize in a particular category the person must cover the total distance for that category within $D$ days.

Then the test cases follow. \r\n- Each test case contains a single line of input, five integers $D, d, A, B, C$. \r\n\r\n###Output\r\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\r\n- $1 \\leq D \\leq 10$\r\n- $1 \\leq d \\leq 5$\r\n- $1 \\leq A \\lt B \\lt C \\leq 10^5$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input\r\n```\r\n3\r\n1 1 1 2 3\r\n10 1 1 2 3\r\n10 3 1 2 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Sample Output\r\n```\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n###Explanation\r\n**Test Case $1$:** The maximum distance covered by Chef is $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ km which is less than any of the available distance categories. Hence Chef won't be able to claim a prize in any of the categories.\r\n\r\n**Test Case $2$:** The maximum distance covered by Chef is $10 \\cdot 1 = 10$ km which is equal to distance of the first category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of $1$ units.\r\n\r\n**Test Case $3$:** The maximum distance covered by Chef is $10 \\cdot 3 = 30$ km which is more than the distance of the second category but less than that of the third category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of $2$ units.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK129\/mandarin\/MARARUN.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK129\/russian\/MARARUN.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK129\/vietnamese\/MARARUN.pdf) and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK129\/bengali\/MARARUN.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nChefland is holding a virtual marathon for the categories $10$ km, $21$ km and $42$ km having prizes $A, B, C$ ($A \\lt B \\lt C$) respectively to promote physical fitness.
