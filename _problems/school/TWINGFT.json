Then Chef chooses the remaining gift with cost $3$. Since Chef moves second, he is allowed to choose one more gift, so he chooses gift with cost $1$. The total cost of Chef's gifts is $3 + 1 = 4$.\r\n\r\n**Test Case $3$:** Chef moves first and at the end he will have the gifts with costs $5$ and $3$.
