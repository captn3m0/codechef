The total tax for each slab is calculated as follows:\r\n- Up to $2.5$ lakh, the tax is Rs. $0$, since the tax rate is $0$ percent.\r\n- From above Rs. $2.5$ lakh to Rs. $5$ lakh, the tax rate is $5$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.05 \\cdot (500,000-250,000)$, which is Rs. $12,500$.\r\n- From above Rs. $5$ lakh to Rs. $6$ lakh, the tax rate is $10$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.10 \\cdot (600,000-500,000)$, which is Rs. $10,000$.\r\n- Summing them up, we get that the total tax on Chef's whole income is Rs. $22,500$. Since the net income is the total income minus the tax reduction, it is Rs. $600,000$ minus Rs. $22,500$, which is Rs. $577,500$.\r\n\r\n**Example case 2:** For income up to Rs. $2.5$ lakh, we have no tax, so the net income is the same as the total income: Rs. $2.5$ lakh.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK115\/hindi\/SLAB.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK115\/mandarin\/SLAB.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK115\/russian\/SLAB.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK115\/vietnamese\/SLAB.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK115\/bengali\/SLAB.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nIn India, every individual is charged with income tax on the total income each year.
