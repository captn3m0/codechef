<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators. <br/><br />
Relational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. Given two numerical values <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is, <br/></br/></br/></p>
<li>First one is greater than second or,</li>
<li>First one is less than second or,</li>
<li>First and second one are equal.</li>
<p> </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains an integer <b>T</b>, which denotes the number of testcases. Each of the <b>T</b> lines contain two integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators<br/><br />
'≺' , '≻' , '='.</br/></p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<li>1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 10000</li>
<li>1 ≤ <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> ≤ 1000000001</li>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
3
10 20
20 10
10 10

<b>Output:</b>
≺
≻
=
</pre><p> </p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In this example 1 as 10 is lesser than 20.</p>
