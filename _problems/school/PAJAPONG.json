The rules of the game are as follows:\n- The players play an infinite number of games. At the end of each game, the player who won it scores a point.\n- In each game, one of the players *serves*. Chef serves in the first game.\n- After every $K$ points are scored (regardless of which players scored them), i.e. whenever $K$ games have been played since the last time the serving player changed, the player that serves in the subsequent games changes: if Chef served in the game that just finished, then Paja will serve in the next game and all subsequent games until the serving player changes again; if Paja served, then Chef will serve.\n\nThe players got a little too caught up in the game and they forgot who is supposed to serve in the next game. Will you help them determine that? So far, Chef has scored $X$ points and Paja has scored $Y$ points.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$ and $K$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string `\"Chef\"` if Chef is supposed to serve next or `\"Paja\"` otherwise (without quotes).\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 50$\n- $0 \\le X, Y \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n1 3 3\n5 7 2\n38657 76322 564\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\nPaja\nChef\nPaja\n```\t\n\t\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** Chef served for the first three games, after that Paja started serving.
