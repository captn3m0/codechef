A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No! I am the one who knocks!\u201d*\r\n\r\nSkyler fears Walter and ponders escaping to Colorado. Walter wants to clean his lab as soon as possible and then go back home to his wife. \r\n\r\nIn order clean his lab, he has to achieve cleaning level of lab as $Y$. The current cleaning level of the lab is $X$. \r\n\r\nHe must choose one positive **odd** integer $a$ and one positive **even** integer $b$. Note that, he cannot change $a$ or $b$ once he starts cleaning.\r\n\r\nHe can perform any one of the following operations for one round of cleaning:  \r\n\u00a0\u00a01. Replace $X$ with $X+a$.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a02.

You can select any other combination of $a, b$ satisfying above condition but will take minimum of $1$ cleaning round in any case.\r\n\r\n- For the second testcase, you can convert $X$ to $Y$ by choosing $a=1$ and $b=10$. In first round they will replace $X$ to $X+a$ and then in second round replace to $X-b$.
