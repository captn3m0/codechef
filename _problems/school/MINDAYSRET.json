This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10^2$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Finally, College has started calling students back to campus. There are so many students and thus due to some safety measures the college can\u2019t call back all the students on the same day. It currently has the capacity of screening $K$ students on a single day. There is a total of $N$ students.

Hence it requires only $1$ day for all students to be back on campus.\n\n**Test case 2:** We have $K = 2$ and $N = 3 \\gt K$, so we can't call all the students back to campus on a single day. But we can call $1$ student on the first day and the remaining $2$ students on the second day. Therefore, we require a minimum of $2$ days for all students to be back on campus.\n\n**Test case 3:** We have $K = 3$ and $N = 4 \\gt K$, so we can't call all the students back to campus on a single day. But we can call $2$ students on the first day and the remaining $2$ students on the second day.
