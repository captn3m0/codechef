### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME91/hindi/SEDARR.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME91/bengali/SEDARR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME91/mandarin/SEDARR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME91/russian/SEDARR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME91/vietnamese/SEDARR.pdf) as well.

The special task force Sed managed to obtain a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): 
- Choose any element of the current sequence and replace it by any positive integer.

You need to make the sum of the elements of the sequence divisible by a given positive integer $K$. Find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to achieve this.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum required number of operations.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1,000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq K \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
3 2
1 1 1
3 3
1 1 1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Example Output
```
1
0
0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Initially, $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$ is not divisible by $K = 2$. We can change $A_1$ to $2$. Now, $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$ is divisible by $K$.

**Example case 2:** For the initial sequence $A$, $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$ is already divisible by $K = 3$, so no operations are required.

**Example case 3:** Again, for the initial sequence $A$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$ is already divisible by $K = 5$, so no operations are required.
