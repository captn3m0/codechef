Meliodas has $X$ chocolates, while Ban has $Y$. Whoever has lesser number of chocolates eats as many chocolates as he has from the other's collection. This eatfest war continues till either they have the __same number of chocolates__, or atleast one of them is left with __no chocolates__.  \nCan you help Elizabeth predict the total no of chocolates they'll be left with at the end of their war?\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, which contains two integers $X, Y$, the no of chocolates Meliodas and Ban have, respectively. \n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the no of chocolates that remain after Ban and Meliodas stop fighting.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100000$\n- $0 \\leq X,Y \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Sample Input:\n3  \n5 3  \n10 10  \n4 8  \n\n###Sample Output:\n2  \n20  \n8  \n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nDenoting Meliodas as $M$, Ban as $B$.\n \nTestcase 1:  \n$M$=5, $B$=3  \nBan eates 3 chocolates of Meliodas.  \n$M$=2, $B$=3  \nMeliodas eats 2 chocolates of Ban.  \n$M$=2, $B$=1  \nBan eates 1 chocolate of Meliodas.  \n$M$=1, $B$=1  \nSince they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.  \nTotal candies left: 2  \n\nTestcase 2:  \n$M$=10, $B$=10  \nSince both of them had the same candies to begin with, there was no point in fighting.  \nTotal candies left: 20  \n\nTestcase 3:  \n$M$=4, $B$=8  \nMeliodas eats 4 chocolates of Ban.  \n$M$=4, $B$=4  \nSince they have the same no of candies, they stop quarreling.  \nTotal candies left: 8  ","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kr_abhinav","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kr_abhinav<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"3-04-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kr_abhinav'>kr_abhinav<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1522873800,"submit_start_date":1522873800,"visible_start_date":1522873800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525198879},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
