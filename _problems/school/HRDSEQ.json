Initially, he wrote $0$, and then he started repeating the following process:\r\n- Look at the last element written so far (the $l$-th element if the sequence has length $l$ so far); let's denote it by $x$.\r\n- If $x$ does not occur anywhere earlier in the sequence, the next element in the sequence is $0$.\r\n- Otherwise, look at the previous occurrence of $x$ in the sequence, i.e. the $k$-th element, where $k \\lt l$, this element is equal to $x$ and all elements between the $k+1$-th and $l-1$-th are different from $x$. The next element is $l-k$, i.e. the distance between the last two occurrences of $x$.\r\n\r\nThe resulting sequence is $(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, \\ldots)$: the second element is $0$ since $0$ occurs only once in the sequence $(0)$, the third element is $1$ since the distance between the two occurrences of $0$ in the sequence $(0, 0)$ is $1$, the fourth element is $0$ since $1$ occurs only once in the sequence $(0, 0, 1)$, and so on.\r\n\r\nChef has given you a task to perform. Consider the $N$-th element of the sequence (denoted by $x$) and the first $N$ elements of the sequence. Find the number of occurrences of $x$ among these $N$ elements.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. \r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the number of occurrences of the $N$-th element.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 128$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 128$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 16$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (70 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 128$\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** The $2$-nd element is $0$.
