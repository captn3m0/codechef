It's Chef's birthday month and so she has decided to organize a big sale in which grand discounts will be provided.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this sale, suppose a recipe should have a discount of <b>x<\/b> percent and its original price (before the sale) is <b>p<\/b>. Statistics says that when people see a discount offered over a product, they are more likely to buy it. Therefore, Chef decides to first increase the price of this recipe by <b>x<\/b>% (from <b>p<\/b>) and then offer a discount of <b>x<\/b>% to people.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chef has a total of <b>N<\/b> types of recipes.

Therefore, Chef first increases the price of each recipe by 10%, from 100 to 110. After that, she decreases the price by 10%, which makes the final price 99. The amount of money lost for each unit is 1, thus losing 5 for recipes of the first type.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is only one recipe of the second type, with price 100 and a 50% discount. Therefore, Chef increases the price of the recipe by 50% from 100 to 150 and after that, she decreases its price by 50% to make its final price 75. She loses 25 for this recipe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall, the amount of money Chef loses is 30.<\/p>\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin2","problem_author_html_handle":"admin2","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"2-02-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin2'>admin2<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy'>easy<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/march18'>march18<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/maths'>maths<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/BIGSALE","time":{"view_start_date":1520847000,"submit_start_date":1520847000,"visible_start_date":1520847000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525454444},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
