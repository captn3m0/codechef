This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq X, Y, Z \\leq 100$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"It's dinner time. Ashish is very hungry and wants to eat something. He has $X$ rupees in his pocket. Since Ashish is very picky, he only likes to eat either `PIZZA` or `BURGER`. In addition, he prefers eating `PIZZA` over eating `BURGER`. The cost of a `PIZZA` is $Y$ rupees while the cost of a `BURGER` is $Z$ rupees. \n\n Ashish can eat at most one thing.

Therefore Ashish can not buy a `PIZZA` but can buy a `BURGER` for his dinner.\n\n**Test case-3:** Ashish has $30$ rupees which are not sufficient to buy either `PIZZA` or `BURGER`.
