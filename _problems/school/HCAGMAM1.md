Given the schedule of Chef for $30$ days (A binary string of length $30$ where `'0'` denotes that Chef was on leave and `'1'` denotes Chef was working on that day). Chef gets $X-$ Rs for every day he worked. As working continuously for a long time is hectic so Company introduced the following policy to give a bonus to its employees.

The company will check the longest streak for which an employee has worked and will award $Y-$ Rs for every day of that streak as a bonus. Calculate the salary received by Chef (including the bonus).

**Note:** Rs represents the currency of Chefland, and if there are two or more longest streaks of the same length, only one is counted for the bonus.
