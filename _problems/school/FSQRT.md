<p><i>In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages </i>
.</p>
<p>
Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance. 
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each T contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each line of input output the square root of the input integer.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1<=T<=20 <br />
1<=N<=10000 <br />
</p>
