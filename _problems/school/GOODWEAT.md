The weather report of Chefland is *Good* if the number of sunny days in a week is strictly greater than the number of rainy days. 

Given $7$ integers $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7$ where $A_i = 1$ denotes that the $i^{th}$ day of week in Chefland is a sunny day, $A_i = 0$ denotes that the $i^{th}$ day in Chefland is a rainy day. Determine if the weather report of Chefland is *Good* or not.
