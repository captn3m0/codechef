This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^4$\n- The sum of $N$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"*\"Let the games begin.\"*\n\nSquid Game has become a blockbuster hit and the frontman is now finding it difficult to accommodate all the participants in Squid Game 2.0. So, he decided that he will allow only those participants who could solve the following problem.\n\n\nThere are a total of $N$ players who are competing in the Squid Game, numbered from $1$ to $N$. When the $i^{\\text{th}}$ player gets eliminated from the game, $A_i$ amount of money is added to the prize pool. The game is played until $N-1$ players get eliminated, and the only player left is declared as the winner. The winner gets all the money present in the prize pool. \n\n\nYou are given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ elements, where $A_i$ denotes the prize money added to the prize pool when the $i^{\\text{th}}$ player gets eliminated from the game. Find the maximum prize that the winner can get, given that you can choose any player to be the winner.\n\n","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$, denoting the number of players.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_N$, denoting the amount of money added to the prize pool when the $i^{\\text{th}}$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$) player dies. \n\n","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each test case, output in a single line the maximum prize that the winner can get, given that you can choose any player to be the winner.\n","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"3\n3\n3 1 2\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n6\n3 6 4 2 5 1\n","output":"5\n4\n20","explanation":"**Test Case 1:**\n- If we choose the first player to be the winner, he will win the game when the second and third players die. Hence, the amount of money won by him will be $1+2 = 3$.\n- If we choose the second player to be the winner, he will win the game when the first and third players die. Hence, the amount of money won by him will be $3+2 = 5$.\n- If we choose the third player to be the winner, he will win the game when the first and second players die. Hence, the amount of money won by him will be $3+1 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, we can clearly see that the maximum amount of money that can be won by any player is $5$. \n\n**Test Case 2:** Irrespective of who is chosen, the winner will always win an amount of $4$.\n\n**Test Case 3:** If we choose the sixth player to be the winner, the amount won by him will be $3 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 20$. It can be proven that if we choose any other player to be the winner, the amount is less than $20$. Hence, the maximum amount of money that can be won by any player is $20$.
