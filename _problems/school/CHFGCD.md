Chef has two positive integers $X$ and $Y$. Now Chef wants to perform some number of operations (possibly zero) on them. In each operation, Chef can choose either $X$ or $Y$ and increment it by $1$. Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that there is a positive integer strictly greater than $1$ which divides both $X$ and $Y$ (In other words, the greatest common divisor of $X$ and $Y$ should be greater than $1$).
