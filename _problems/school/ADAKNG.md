Chef Ada is training to defend her title of World Chess Champion.

To train her calculation skills, Ada placed a <a >king</a> on a chessboard. Remember that a chessboard has $8$ rows and $8$ columns (for the purposes of this problem, both the rows and the columns are numbered $1$ through $8$); let's denote the square in row $r$ and column $c$ by $(r, c)$. A king on a square $(r, c)$ can move to another square $(r', c')$ if and only if $(r'-r)^2+(c'-c)^2 \le 2$.

Ada placed her king on the square $(R, C)$. Now, she is counting the number of squares that can be visited (reached) by the king in at most $K$ moves. Help Ada verify her answers.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $R$, $C$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of squares the king can visit.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 512$
- $1 \le R, C, K \le 8$

### Example Input
```
1
1 3 1
```

### Example Output
```
6
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The king can stay on its original square or move to one of the squares circled in the following figure.
