<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>### Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/hindi/CV.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/bengali/CV.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/mandarin/CV.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/russian/CV.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/vietnamese/CV.pdf) as well.

Chef has a string $S$ with length $N$. He needs to find the number of indices $i$ ($1 \le i \le N-1$) such that the $i$-th character of this string is a consonant and the $i+1$-th character is a vowel. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.

Note: The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels; all other lowercase English letters are consonants.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of occurrences of a vowel immediately after a consonant.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
6
bazeci
3
abu
1
o
```

### Example Output
```
3
1
0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The vowel 'a' follows after the consonant 'b', 'e' follows after 'z' and 'i' follows after 'c', so the answer is $3$.

**Example case 2:** The only vowel 'u' follows after 'b', so the answer is $1$.
