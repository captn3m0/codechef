The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.\r\n\r\nYou are given two sequences $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ and $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N$. For each valid $i$, player $i$ scored $A_i$ goals and committed $B_i$ fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets $20$ points, and for each foul, $10$ points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have $0$ points instead.\r\n\r\nYou need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\r\n- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of points.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 150$\r\n- $0 \\le A_i \\le 50$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $0 \\le B_i \\le 50$ for each valid $i$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 2$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3\r\n40 30 50\r\n2 4 20\r\n1\r\n0\r\n10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n800\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** The first player gets $800$ points for scoring goals and has $20$ points deducted for fouls.
