### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME93/bengali/SMOL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME93/mandarin/SMOL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME93/russian/SMOL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME93/vietnamese/SMOL.pdf) as well.

You are given two integers $N$ and $K$. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): change $N$ to $N-K$, i.e. subtract $K$ from $N$. Find the smallest non-negative integer value of $N$ you can obtain this way.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the smallest value you can get.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq K \leq 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
5 2
4 4
2 5
```

### Example Output
```
1
0
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- First, we change $N = 5$ to $N - K = 5 - 2 = 3$.
- Then, we have $N = 3$ and we change it to $N - K = 3 - 2 = 1$.

Since $1 \lt K$, the process stops here and the smallest value is $1$.

**Example case 2:** We change $N = 4$ to $N - K = 4 - 4 = 0$. Since $0 \lt K$, the process stops here and the smallest value is $0$.

**Example case 3:** Since $2 \lt K$ initially, we should not perform any operations and the smallest value is $2$.
