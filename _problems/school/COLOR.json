Chef's house has <b>N<\/b> rooms in it numbered from 1 to <b>N<\/b>. Each room is currently painted in one of the red, blue or green colors. Your are given configuration of colors of his house by a string <b>S<\/b> consisting of <b>N<\/b> characters. In this string, color red will be denoted by 'R', green by 'G' and blue by 'B'.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nChef does not like current painting configuration that much and would like to repaint the house such that each room has same color. <\/p>\n<p>For painting, Chef has all the 3 color paints available and mixing any 2 color paints will result into 3rd color paint i.e\n<ul>\n<li>R + B = G<\/li>\n<li>B + G = R<\/li>\n<li>G + R = B<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p><p> <\/p>\n<p>For example, painting a room having red color before with green color paint will make the color of room blue.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlso, Chef has many buckets of paint of each color.
