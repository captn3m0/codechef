This year Chef is participating in a Dancing competition. The dance performance will be done on a linear stage marked with integral positions. Initially, Chef is present at position $X$ and Chef's dance partner is at position $Y$. Chef can perform two kinds of dance moves.

If Chef is currently at position $k$, Chef can:
1. Moonwalk to position $k+2$, or
2. Slide to position $k-1$

Chef wants to find the **minimum** number of moves required to reach his partner. Can you help him find this number?
