All the problems don't necessarily have the same points assigned to them - you are given an array $A$ of integers, where $A_i$ denotes the points assigned to the $i^{th}$ problem. If a participant solves the $i^{th}$ problem, they will get $A_i$ points added to their total score. Note that there are no partial points - they can get only $0$ or $A_i$ points on the $i^{th}$ problem. For each participant $i$, you are also given their final verdict in each problem in the form of a binary string $S_i$ - a $1$ denotes that they solved that problem, and a $0$ denotes that they did not. \r\n\r\nYour job is to find the total score of each participant.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \r\n- First line of each testcase contains $2$ space separated integers, $N$ and $K$, denoting the number of participants and the number of problems in the contest respectively.\r\n- The second line contains $K$ space separated integers - $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_K$, where $A_i$ denotes the points assigned to the $i^{th}$  problem.\r\n- The $i^{th}$ of the next $N$ lines contains a binary string $S_i$ of length $K$, where $S_{ij}$ represents the verdict of the $j^{th}$ problem for $i^{th}$ participant. $S_{ij} = 1$ if they solved that problem, and $S_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\nFor each testcase, output $N$ lines, with the $i^{th}$ line containing a single integer denoting the total score of the $i^{th}$ participant.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\r\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5$\r\n- $0 \\leq S_{ij} \\leq 1$\r\n- Sum of $N * K$ over all tests is atmost $10^6$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n```\r\n3\r\n2 2\r\n1 2\r\n01\r\n10\r\n2 2\r\n1 2\r\n11\r\n00\r\n2 1\r\n100\r\n0\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n```\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n0\r\n0\r\n100\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n###Explanation:\r\n**Case 1:** The first participant's binary string is \"$01$\", which means that they did not solve the first problem, but they solved the second problem. And as the points assigned to the two problems are $1$ and $2$, the total score of the first participant is $2$. Hence the first output is $2$.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the second participant's binary string is \"$10$\", which means that they solved the first problem, but did not solve the second problem. So their total score is $1$. Hence the second output is $1$.\r\n\r\n**Case 2:** The first participant's binary string is \"$11$\", which means that they solved both the first and second problems. And as the points assigned to the two problems are $1$ and $2$, the total score of the first participant is $1 + 2 = 3$. Hence the third output is $3$.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the second participant's binary string is \"$00$\", which means that they did not solve any problem. So their total score is $0$. And hence the fourth output is $0$.\r\n\r\n**Case 3:** The first participant's binary string is \"$0$\", which means that they did not solve the only problem of the contest. Hence the total score of the first participant is $0$. Hence the fifth output is $0$.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the second participant's binary string is \"$1$\", which means that they solved the only problem in the contest. And as the points assigned to that problem is $100$, the total score of the second participant is $100$. Hence the last output is $100$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/CCRC2021\/hindi\/TOTSCR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/CCRC2021\/mandarin\/TOTSCR.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/CCRC2021\/vietnamese\/TOTSCR.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/CCRC2021\/bengali\/TOTSCR.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nThere are $K$ problems in a contest with $N$ participants.
