Chef Ada is training her calculation skills. She wants to place a <a href="">king</a> and some obstacles on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard">chessboard</a> in such a way that the number of distinct cells the king can reach is exactly $K$.

Recall that a chessboard has $8$ rows (numbered $1$ through $8$) and $8$ columns (numbered $1$ through $8$); let's denote a cell in row $r$ and column $c$ by $(r,c)$.

In one move, a king can move to any adjacent cell which shares a side or corner with its current cell and does not contain an obstacle. More formally, a king in a cell $(r,c)$ can move to any cell $(r_n,c_n)$ if $(r_n,c_n)$ is a valid cell of the chessboard which does not contain an obstacle and $(r-r_n)^2+(c-c_n)^2 \le 2$. 

A cell $(x,y)$ can be reached by a king if, after an arbitrary number of moves (including zero), the king is in the cell $(x,y)$.

Help Ada find any valid configuration of the board such that the king can reach exactly $K$ distinct cells. It is guaranteed that such a configuration always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print $8$ lines describing a chessboard, each containing $8$ characters. For each valid $i$ and $j$, the $j$-th character on the $i$-th line should be one of the following:
- 'O' if the cell $(i,j)$ initially contains the king; there should be exactly one such cell
- 'X' if the cell $(i,j)$ contains an obstacle
- '.' if the cell $(i,j)$ is empty

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 64$
- $1 \le K \le 64$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $K \le 8$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
1
5
9
64

### Explanation
The descriptions of the chessboard for each test case are separated by blank lines for clarity. Note that these lines should not appear on the output of your submission.

**Example case 1:** The king is surrounded by obstacles, so it cannot move â€• the only cell it can reach is its initial cell.

**Example case 4:** The king can visit all cells of the board.
