Team RCB has earned $X$ points in the games it has played so far in this year's IPL. To qualify for the playoffs they must earn **at least** a total of $Y$ points. They currently have $Z$ games left, in each game they earn $2$ points for a win, $1$ point for a draw, and no points for a loss.

Is it possible for RCB to qualify for the playoffs this year?
