### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/bengali/MAXTOPO.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/mandarin/MAXTOPO.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/russian/MAXTOPO.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/vietnamese/MAXTOPO.pdf) as well.

Chef has a tree $G$ with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N-1$ undirected edges. For each node $u$ in the tree, he can assign directions to the edges in such a way that $u$ is reachable from all the other nodes. Let $C_u$ be the number of valid [topological orderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) in the resulting directed acyclic graph.

This way, Chef obtains $N$ pairs $(C_1,1), (C_2,2), \ldots, (C_N,N)$ and he sorts all these pairs $(C_i, i)$ in descending order (first by $C_i$ and in the case of a tie by $i$). 

For example, consider the tree below:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/Images/MARCH21/MAXTOPO/MAXTOPO_eg.png)

The sorted list of pairs is $((2,2), (1,3), (1,1))$.

Chef quizzes you on this list â€• he wants you to find the $K$-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for $K = 1$ (the largest pair) or $K = 2$ (the second largest pair). Since the number of topological orderings can be very large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$. 

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$, denoting that nodes $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers $u$ and $C_u$ modulo $10^9+7$, where $(C_u, u)$ is the $K$-th pair in the sorted list.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq K \leq 2$
- $1 \leq u,v \leq N$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $N \leq 10$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $K = 1$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** $K = 2$

### Example Input
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 3
2 4
```

### Example Output
```
4 2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The tree is

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/Images/MARCH21/MAXTOPO/MAXTOPO_sample.png)

- For $u = 1$, there are $C_1 = 2$ possible topological orderings: $(3,4,2,1)$ and $(4,3,2,1)$
- For $u = 2$, there are $C_2 = 6$ possible topological orderings: $(3,4,1,2)$, $(4,3,1,2)$, $(3,1,4,2)$, $(4,1,3,2)$, $(1,3,4,2)$ and $(1,4,3,2)$.
- For $u = 3$, there are $C_3 = 2$ possible topological orderings: $(1,4,2,3)$ and $(4,1,2,3)$.
- For $u = 4$, there are $C_4 = 2$ possible topological orderings: $(3,1,2,4)$ and $(1,3,2,4)$.

The sorted list of pairs is $((6,2), (2,4), (2,3), (2,1))$. The node for the $2$-nd pair is $4$ and the corresponding number of topological orderings modulo $10^9+7$ is $2$.
