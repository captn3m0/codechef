In the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:
- a Bit - $2\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)
- a Nibble - $8\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte
- a Byte - $16\;\mathrm{ms}$ after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears

Chef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time $N\;\mathrm{ms}$ if only 1 Bit appeared at time $0\;\mathrm{ms}$?

Help him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers â€” the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $1 \le N \le 1,600$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (25 points):** $1 \le N \le 140$

**Subtask #2 (75 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2
3
```

### Example Output
```
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

### Explanation
Immediately before the time $2\;\mathrm{ms}$, there is only one Bit. At $2\;\mathrm{ms}$, this Bit grows up, so immediately before $3\;\mathrm{ms}$, there is only one Nibble in Byteland.
