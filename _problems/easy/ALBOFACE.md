### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/mandarin/ALBOFACE.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/bengali/ALBOFACE.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/russian/ALBOFACE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/vietnamese/ALBOFACE.pdf) as well.

Alice and Bob have got an integer $N$. They decide to play a game. Alice and Bob make alternating moves: Alice makes the first move, Bob makes the second move, Alice makes the third one, and so on. The game continues until $N$ becomes $0$. The player who is unable to make a move loses.

During each turn a player can make one of the following moves:

1. Choose an integer $X$ such that $X$ can be expressed as $2^Y$, $Y \geq 1$. The chosen $X$ must also be a factor of $N$. After choosing an integer $X$ which satisfies the mentioned criteria, the player will divide $N$ by $X$. 

2. If Move $1$ is not possible , the player will subtract $1$ from $N$.

Predict the winner of the game if the game is played optimally by both the players.
