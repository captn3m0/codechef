### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/LGSEG.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/LGSEG.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/LGSEG.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/LGSEG.pdf) as well.

Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Let's call a contiguous subsequence of $A$ a *segment*.

A segment is *good* if it can be divided into at most $K$ segments such that the sum of elements in each of these sub-segments is at most $S$.

You need to find the maximum number of elements in a good segment.
