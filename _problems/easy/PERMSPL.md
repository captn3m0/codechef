### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME88/hindi/PERMSPL.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME88/bengali/PERMSPL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME88/mandarin/PERMSPL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME88/russian/PERMSPL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME88/vietnamese/PERMSPL.pdf) as well.

For a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_K$, let's define the number of inversions in it as the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i \lt j \le K$ and $A_i \gt A_j$.

You are given a permutation $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$ of the integers $1$ through $N$. Determine if it is possible to partition this permutation into two subsequences (possibly empty or non-contiguous) such that:
- Each element of $P$ appears in exactly one of these subsequences.
- The numbers of inversions in one subsequence is equal to the number of inversions in the other subsequence.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"YES"` if it is possible to partition the permutation in a given way or `"NO"` if it is impossible.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le P_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$ are pairwise distinct
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $N \le 16$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
1
1
3
3 2 1
4
4 3 2 1
5 
1 4 3 2 5
```

### Example Output
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We can split $(1)$ into $(1)$ and $()$. There are $0$ inversions in each of these sequences.

**Example case 3:** We can split $(4, 3, 2, 1)$ into $(4, 3)$ and $(2, 1)$. There is $1$ inversion in each of them. Note that this is not the only solution â€• we could also split the permutation into sequences $(4, 1)$ and $(3, 2)$.
