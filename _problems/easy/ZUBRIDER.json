The guards in the shopping mall were unable to catch the kid as he has got a fast scooter.\n<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com\/download\/upload\/ACM17KOL\/ZUBRIDER\/club_of_riders.png\">\n<p>\nEach scooter has a performance value. Also, this kind of scooter needs a skilled rider to perform well. The total performance of a rider is measured by the value of scooter performance multiplied by rider\u2019s skill. A rider <b>X<\/b> can catch a rider <b>Y<\/b> only if <b>X<\/b>\u2019s total performance is more than <b>Y<\/b>\u2019s.The shopping mall manager has bought one scooter for each guard. However, as he has bought them from an wholesale offer, their performance values need not be the same.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEach guard gets a scooter and of course, a scooter can be assigned to only one guard. Now, the manager wants to assign the scooters to the guards. Everyday the guards are on duty in different places and that's why each has to be able to catch the kid and only then an assignment will be valid.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSo in short, given the skill of that kid, his scooter\u2019s performance value, each guard\u2019s skill, and each scooter\u2019s performance value, find out the number of valid assignments possible. In a valid assignment, each guard will be able to catch the kid. As the result can be very large, find the mod 10<sup>9<\/sup> + 7 of the result.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
