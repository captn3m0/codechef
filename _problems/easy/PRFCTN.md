### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/bengali/PRFCTN.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/mandarin/PRFCTN.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/russian/PRFCTN.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME78/vietnamese/PRFCTN.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You should make all its elements equal by performing a sequence of operations.

In one operation, you may choose any contiguous subsequence $A_l, A_{l+1}, \ldots, A_r$ such that for each $i$ ($l+1 \le i \le r$), $A_i = A_l$, i.e. a sequence of identical elements, then choose any integer $x \lt A_l$, and for each $i$ ($l \le i \le r$), replace $A_i$ by $x$. The integers $x$ chosen in different operations may be different.

Find the smallest number of operations necessary to make all elements of the given sequence equal.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest number of operations.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $A_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints
