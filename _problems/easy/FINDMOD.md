### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/mandarin/FINDMOD.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/bengali/FINDMOD.pdf), and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/russian/FINDMOD.pdf) as well.

The jury has a secret number $N$, where $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$. You want to know this number, and you are allowed to ask the jury some queries. In each query, you give the jury a number $X$ where $0 \le X \le 2 \cdot 10^{18}$, and the jury tells you $X \mod{N}$.

Please find $N$ using at most **two** queries per test case.

### Interaction Format

- The first line of contains $T$ - the number of test cases.
- For each test case, you are allowed to allowed to ask the jury **at most two queries**. To make a query, output `? X` on one line; the jury will return the value of $x \mod {N}$ to the input for you to read.
    - In the case you exceed the number of queries, the judge will exit with the Wrong Answer verdict.
- Once you have found the answer, output `! N` on one line. This **does not count** as a query. 
    - If you output the wrong value for $N$, the judge will exit with the Wrong Answer verdict; if you output the correct value for $N$, the judge will **silently** continues. This means you should start asking queries for the next test case right after outputting the value of $N$ for the previous test case.
