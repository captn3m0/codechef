<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>You were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: 

- Multiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7          
- Outputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once)          

Your friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device-           
- Given a three-digit positive number $K$, he feeds it to the device for processing.          
- He then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out.          
- Repeats the above step $N$ times.          

To test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. Can you?

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $K, N$.

###Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps.

###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$          
- $5 \leq N \leq 10^9$          
- Each digit of $K$ is non-zero           

###Sample Input:
1          
123 5         

###Sample Output:
 27
