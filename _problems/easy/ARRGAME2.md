8. Chef randomly choose some number **x** from his gift.
9. Sasha randomly choose some number **y** form her gift.
10. If **xy &gt; yx** then girl will kiss fellow.
11. Numbers **x,y** will be discarded from gifts.
Now chef is wondering what is the expected number of times he will be kissed by Sasha ? ### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N** denoting the number of numbers in each gift. The second line contains **N** space-separated integers **A1**, **A2**, ..., **AN** denoting the numbers Sasha gave to Chef. Next line describe **B1**, **B2**, ..., **BN** numbers boy gave to girl in the same way.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing answer for corresponding test. Your answer will be considered as correct if it will have absolute error not more then **10-6**. ### Constraints

22. **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **105**
23. **1** ≤ **Ai** ≤ **109**
24. **1** ≤ **Bi** ≤ **109**
