You\u2019re bored in your house and are playing golf in the hallway. \r\n\r\nThe hallway has $N + 2$ tiles numbered from $0$ to $N+1$ from left to right. There is a hole on tile number $x$. You hit the ball standing on tile $0$. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of $k$, i.e. the tiles covered by it are $0, k, 2k, \\ldots$, and so on until the ball passes tile $N+1$.\r\n\r\nIf the ball doesn't enter the hole in the first trial, you try again but this time standing on the tile $N+1$.
