<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>You are given a sequence of integers <b>$A_1,A_2,â€¦,A_N$</b> and a magical non-zero integer $x$</p>
<p>You have to select a subsegment of sequence A (possibly empty), and replace the elements in that subsegment after dividing them by x.</p>

<p>Formally, replace any one subsegment $A_l, A_{l+1}, ..., A_r$ with $A_l/x, A_{l+1}/x, ..., A_r/x$ where $l \leq r$</p>
    
<p>What is the minimum possible sum you can obtain?</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The given operation can only be performed once</p>
<h3>Input </h3>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the input contains two positive integer n denoting the size of array, and x
denoting the magical integer</li>
<li>Next line contains $N$ space separated integers</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Output</h3>
Single line containing one real number, denoting the minimum possible sum you can obtain. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-2}$

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>$1 \leq n \leq 10^3$</li>
<li>$1 \leq |x| \leq 10^3$</li>
<li>$ |A_i| \leq 10^3$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>3 2
1 -2 3<pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>0.5</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Array 1 -2 <b>3</b>, selecting subsegment {3}, you get 1 -2 <b>1.5</b>, which gives $sum=0.5$</p>
