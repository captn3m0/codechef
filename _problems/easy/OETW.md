For her birthday, Rima got an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. Each element of this sequence is either 1 or 2.

Let's call an integer $s$ ($1 \le s \le 2N$) a *summary integer* if there is a contiguous subsequence of $A$ such that the sum of its elements is equal to $s$.

Rima wants to count all the summary integers. Can you help her?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of summary integers.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^6$
- $1 \le A_i \le 2$ for each valid $i$

### Example Input
```
1
3
2 1 2
```

### Example Output
```
4
```
