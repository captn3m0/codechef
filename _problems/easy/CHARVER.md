### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/bengali/CHARVER.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/mandarin/CHARVER.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/russian/CHARVER.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/vietnamese/CHARVER.pdf) as well.

Given an array $C$ of $M$ integers and a square matrix $A$ (with integer entries) of dimension $N \times N$, verify whether the following equation is true,

$$C_0 I_{N} + C_1 A + C_2 A^2 + \dots C_{M-1} A^{M-1}  \equiv 0_N \pmod{998244353}$$

where $0_N$ is the square null matrix (matrix in which all elements are zero) and $I_N$ is the identity matrix, both having dimensions $N \times N$.

**Note:** 
- Two matrices $A, B$ each with integer entries are said to be *congruent* modulo $M$ iff all entries of $A - B$ are divisible by $M$. This is denoted as $A \equiv B \pmod{M}$.
- Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
