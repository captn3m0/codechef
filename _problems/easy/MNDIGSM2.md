_This problem is similar to the problem "MNDIGSUM". The only differences are in the constraints and in the input format. In this problem the range for the base $B$ is $[2, R]$, the value of $n$ can be upto $10^{12}$ and the total number of queries is at most $300$. The differences are described in bold._


Let $f(n, B)$ be the sum of digits of the integer $n$ when written in base $B$.

More formally, if $n = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i B^i$ where $a_i$ is an integer in the range $[0, B-1]$, then $f(n, B) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i$.

Given $Q$ queries, each consisting of **two** integers $n$ and $r$. Find the value of $B$ corresponding to which $f(n, B)$ is minimum for all ${\bf{2}} \leq B \leq r$. If there are multiple such values, you can print any of them.
