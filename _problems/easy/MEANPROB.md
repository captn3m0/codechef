You are given a sequence $a$ and its first $n$ elements. 

The $i$-th element of the sequence, where $i > n$ is generated by the following formula.

The $i$-th element $i > n$ would be the floor of the mean of last $n$ elements of the sequence. Formally,

$$a_i = \lfloor \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{i-n+k}}{n} \rfloor$$

For example, 

$$  a_{n+1} = \lfloor \frac{a_1 + a_2 + .. + a_{n}}{n} \rfloor$$
$$ a_{n+2} = \lfloor \frac{a_2 + a_3 + .. + a_{n+1}}{n} \rfloor$$
$$ a_{n+3} = \lfloor \frac{a_3 + a_4 + .. + a_{n+2}}{n} \rfloor$$

You have to answer many queries in which you would be asked to tell some x-th element of the sequence, where $x$ would be provided in the query.

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- First line of each test case contains an integer $n$.
- The second of each test case contains $n$ space separated integers where $i$-th of which denotes value of $a_i$.
- The third line contains an integer $Q$ denoting the number of queries.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains an integer $x$, denoting that you should tell what's the $x$-th element of sequence.

###Output:
For each query, output an integer denoting the value of the corresponding element of the sequence.

###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq n \leq 10^3$
- for $1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq x \leq 10^9$

###Sample Input:
    1
    3
    2 2 3
    3
    1
    3
    4


###Sample Output:
    2
    3
    2

### Explanation
The 4th element of the array would be $$\lfloor \frac{2+2+3}{3} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{7}{3} \rfloor = 2$$
