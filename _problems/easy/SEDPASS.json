The six substrings of $S$ are \"a\", \"a\", \"?\", \"aa\", \"a?\" and \"aa?\" (note that \"a\" is counted twice). Which of them are good?\r\n- \"a\" is not good as 'a' occurs an odd number of times in this substring and there are no '?' to replace.\r\n- \"?\" is also not good as replacing '?' by any letter causes this letter to occur in $R$ an odd number of times.\r\n- \"aa\" is a good substring because each letter occurs in it an even number of times and there are no '?' to replace.\r\n- \"a?\" is also a good substring. We can replace '?' with 'a'. Then, $R$ is \"aa\" and each letter occurs in this string an even number of times. Note that replacing '?' e.g. with 'b' would not work ($R$ would be \"ab\", where both 'a' and 'b' occur an odd number of times), but we may choose the replacement letter $C$ appropriately.\r\n- \"aa?\" is not a good substring. For any replacement letter $C$, we find that $C$ occurs an odd number of times in $R$.\r\n\r\n**Example case 2:** We especially note that \"a???\" is not a good substring. Since all '?' have to be replaced by the same character, we can only get strings of the form \"aaaa\", \"abbb\", \"accc\", etc., but none of them match the criteria for a good substring.\r\n\r\n**Example case 3:** Any substring with even length is good.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK125\/hindi\/SEDPASS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK125\/mandarin\/SEDPASS.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK125\/russian\/SEDPASS.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK125\/vietnamese\/SEDPASS.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK125\/bengali\/SEDPASS.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nThe notorious hacker group \"Sed\" managed to obtain a string $S$ from their secret sources.
