This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1\\le N,Q\\le 2\\cdot10^5$\n- $1\\le A_i\\le N$\n- $1\\le x,y\\le N$\n- $1\\le k\\le N$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (20 points):** No type $1$ queries\n- **Subtask 2 (80 points):** Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Given is a sequence $A$ of length $N$.\n\nDefine $f(i,j)$ to be the number of distinct elements in $A_i,A_{i+1},\\ldots,A_j$.\n\nYou need to process $Q$ queries of the following two types:\n\n- $1\\ x\\ y$ \u2014 set $A_x = y$.\n- $2\\ k$ \u2014 print $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{k}\\sum\\limits_{j=i}^{k}f(i,j)$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $Q$ \u2014 the size of the array and the number of queries.\n- The second line of input contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_N$.\n- Then, $Q$ lines follow, describing queries in the format given in the statement.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each type $2$ query, print the answer to it on a new line.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"3 2\n1 2 2\n2 2\n2 3\n","output":"4\n8\n","explanation":"**Test Case $1$:** The answer is $f(1,1)+f(1,2)+f(2,2)=1+2+1=4$.\n\n**Test Case $2$:** The answer is $f(1,1) + f(1,2)+f(1,3)+f(2,2)+f(2,3)+f(3,3)=1+2+2+1+1+1=8$.","isDeleted":false},{"id":"2","input":"5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 5\n1 1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n","output":"35\n8\n17\n31\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"mazihang2022","problem_author_html_handle":"mazihang2022","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"25-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/jan221'>jan221<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/mazihang2022'>mazihang2022<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Easy-Medium","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/MASTER","time":{"view_start_date":1641807000,"submit_start_date":1641807000,"visible_start_date":1641807000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797838},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=MASTER","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
