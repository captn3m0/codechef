{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"EXUNB","problem_name":"Tennis Tournament","body":"A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.\r\nEvery player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. \r\n\r\nWith Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  \r\n\r\nYour task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \r\n- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\n- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\r\n- Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. \r\n- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. \r\n- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.\r\n- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\r\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\r\n\r\n###Subtasks\r\n- 10 points : $2 \\leq N \\leq 6$\r\n- 90 points :  Original Constraints. \r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n```\r\nYES\r\n010\r\n001\r\n100\r\nNO\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Explanation:\r\nOne such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$.
