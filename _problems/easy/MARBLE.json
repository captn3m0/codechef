This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- The sum of all $N$ across all test cases does not exceed $5*10^5$.\n- $|S| = |P|$\n- Every character of both $S$ and $P$ is either a lowercase English alphabet or $?$.\n- Every $?$ present in $S$ and $P$ should be assigned the same character.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"*\"You have a reason to leave this place, but I don't.\"*\n\nIn the fourth game, Sang-Woo and Ali are competing against each other. Sang-Woo is the more intelligent one between them, and he plans to win the game by cheating. Ali is your childhood friend and you want to help him win this game. The game goes as follows.\n\nBoth of them are given $2$ strings \u2014 $S$ and $P$ \u2014 of equal length (say $N$). The task is to find the **minimum** number of operations required to convert the string $P$ into $S$. Every character of both $S$ and $P$ is either a lowercase English alphabet or $?$.\n\nFirst, before performing any operation, you must choose a single lowercase character from the English alphabet, and replace every occurrence of $?$ with this character. Note that every $?$ present in either $S$ or $P$ is replaced by the **exact same** character. This does not count as an operation.\n\nOnce the above step is done, you are allowed to perform the following two operations on $P$ any number of times:\n- Pick an index $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ such that $P_i$ is a vowel, and change $P_i$ to any consonant.\n- Pick an index $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ such that $P_i$ is a consonant, and change $P_i$ to any vowel.\n\n**Note:** The vowels are the $5$ characters $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ \u2014 the other $21$ are consonants.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to convert $P$ into $S$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$, denoting the length of strings $S$ and $P$.\n- The second and third lines contain strings $S$ and $P$ respectively.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of operations required to convert $P$ into $S$.\n","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"3\n5\nab?c?\naeg?k\n6\nabcde?\nehio??\n4\nabcd\nabcd","output":"4\n6\n0","explanation":"**Test Case 1:** First, replace every $?$ by $u$.

Convert $P_4 = u$ to $c$ in 1 operation.\n4.
