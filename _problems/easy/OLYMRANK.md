### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/bengali/OLYMRANK.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/mandarin/OLYMRANK.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/russian/OLYMRANK.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/vietnamese/OLYMRANK.pdf) as well.

The Chef is at the Olympics. You are given the medal tally of $N$ of the participating countries. 

You are also given $Q$ queries, each represented by a single integer $K$. For each such query, you need to find the best possible rank country $1$ can achieve if you are allowed to take **atmost** $K$ medals (possibly of different countries) and change their color.

**Note**: 
- Countries are ranked lexicographically in order of their gold, silver, and bronze medals. If countries $i$ and $j$ have the same number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, then country $i$ is considered to be ahead of country $j$ if and only if $i \lt j$. There are no ties in the rank list. 
- Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
