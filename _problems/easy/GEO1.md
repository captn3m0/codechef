### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/bengali/GEO1.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/mandarin/GEO1.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/russian/GEO1.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/vietnamese/GEO1.pdf) as well.

You are given a convex polygon with $N$ sides. You have to answer $Q$ queries. The $i^{th}$ query is described by two integers $v_i, t_i$. In this query, all sides of the polygon start moving parallel to their respective perpendicular vector away from the centroid with a constant velocity of $v_i \frac{units}{sec}$. Output the final area covered by $N$ sides of the polygon after time $t_i$ seconds. 

For each query,  consider the initial coordinates of vertices of the given polygon.

**Note:** 
- Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
- The problem requires high precision, so prefer using data types with a precision equivalent to long double in C++.
