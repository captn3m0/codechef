### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/hindi/GDSUB.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/bengali/GDSUB.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/mandarin/GDSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/russian/GDSUB.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT19/vietnamese/GDSUB.pdf) as well.

Chef is given a sequence of prime numbers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. This sequence has exactly $2^N$ subsequences. A subsequence of $A$ is *good* if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.

Chef has to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most $K$ numbers. Since he does not know much about subsequences, help him find the answer. This number could be very large, so compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of good subsequences with size at most $K$, modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^5$
- $2 \le A_i \le 8,000$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (40 points):** $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ are pairwise distinct

**Subtask #2 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
5 3
2 2 3 3 5
```

### Example Output
```
18
```

### Explanation
There is $1$ good subsequence with length $0$, $5$ good subsequences with length $1$, $8$ good subsequences with length $2$ and $4$ good subsequences with length $3$.
