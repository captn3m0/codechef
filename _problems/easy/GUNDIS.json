{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"GUNDIS","problem_name":"Gun Distribution","body":"The fight between Sardar Khan and Sultan to control Wasseypur is getting very intense. Sultan has asked Ramadhir to supply him with automatic guns and Wasseypur is about to become a war zone. But Sultan's sister Shama has revealed her brother's plans to her husband, Danish. The Sardar family must also buy automatic guns or risk annihilation.\n\n\nThe gun merchant they are buying guns from is very peculiar. He only sells guns to a person if the either sold the last gun to the same person or if the person is buying the gun for the first time. So if, Danish and Faizal go to buy guns, and Faizal buys the first gun after which Danish buys another, then Faial can no longer buy any gun as the last gun was not sold to him and he has already bought a gun. Meanwhile, Danish can buy as many more guns as he wants.\n\n\nThe merchant has $N$ guns in stock and each gun has a type $A_i$. He will only sell them in a particular order, he will also not sell more than a $1000$ guns to any one person. \n\n\nSardar Khan wants his lackeys to visit the gun merchant and buy all the guns. Every lackey wants as many different types of guns as possible, for the intimidation power of a lackey is the number of unique guns they have. While the total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets from his lackeys is the product of their individual intimidation power.\n\n\nSardar needs to wins the fight against Sultan and asks his lackeys to buy the guns optimally, to maximise Sardar's intimidation power.\n\n\nFind out the maximum intimidation power Sardar Khan can get.\n\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases is less than or equal to $2\\cdot 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"The fight between Sardar Khan and Sultan to control Wasseypur is getting very intensifying. Sultan has asked Ramadhir to supply him with automatic guns in an attempt to dominate the battlefield. The Sardar family must also buy automatic guns or risk annihilation.\n\nThe gun merchant Sardar is buying guns from has $N$ guns in stock, the $i$-th of which has type $A_i$. He sells these guns according to the following peculiar rules:\n- Only one person can buy guns at a time.\n- For all $1 < i \\leq N$, he will sell the $i$-th gun only if the $(i-1)$-th gun has already been sold to somebody. The first gun can be sold directly with no restriction.\n- Once some guns are sold to a person and they leave, they will not be allowed to come back in later and purchase any more guns.\n\nAs a result, any buyer can only own a consecutive set of guns - if the first unsold gun when they enter has index $L$, they can only buy guns $L, L+1, L+2, \\dots, R$ where $L \\leq R \\leq N$, and the choice of $R$ is left to them.\n\nSardar Khan wants his lackeys to visit the gun merchant and buy all the guns. The *intimidation power* of a lackey is the number of distinct types of guns in his possession. The total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets from his lackeys is the product of all of their individual intimidation powers (to ensure this value is non-zero, only consider the product over all lackeys who purchase at least one weapon from this merchant).\nSardar can send as few or as many lackeys to the merchant as he likes, as long as every weapon is purchased by at least one of them.\n\nSardar obviously would like to maximize his intimidation power. Find out what this maximum value is, given that his lackeys buy guns optimally. The answer can be large, so print it modulo $10^9 + 7$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
