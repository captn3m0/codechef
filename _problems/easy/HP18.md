<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/hindi/HP18.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/bengali/HP18.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/mandarin/HP18.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/russian/HP18.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN19/vietnamese/HP18.pdf) as well.

Bob and Alice are playing a game with the following rules:
- Initially, they have an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$; in addition, Bob has a *lucky number* $a$ and Alice has a lucky number $b$.
- The players alternate turns. In each turn, the current player must remove a non-zero number of elements from the sequence; each removed element should be a multiple of the lucky number of this player.
- If it is impossible to remove any elements, the current player loses the game.

It is clear that one player wins the game after a finite number of turns. Find the winner of the game if Bob plays first and both Bob and Alice play optimally.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $a$ and $b$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"ALICE"` if the winner is Alice or `"BOB"` if the winner is Bob (without quotes).

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le a, b \le 100$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (18 points):** $a = b$

**Subtask #2 (82 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
5 2 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Example Output
```
ALICE
BOB
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Bob removes $3$ and the sequence becomes $[1, 2, 4, 5]$. Then, Alice removes $2$ and the sequence becomes $[1, 4, 5]$. Now, Bob is left with no moves, so Alice is the winner.
