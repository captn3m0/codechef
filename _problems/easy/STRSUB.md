All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH15/mandarin/STRSUB.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH15/russian/STRSUB.pdf).

You are given a string **S** of length **N** consisting only of 0s and **1**s. You are also given an integer **K**.

You have to answer **Q** queries. In the **i**th query, two integers **Li** and **Ri** are given. Then you should print the number of substrings of **S\[L, R\]** which contain at most **K** 0s and at most **K** **1**s where **S\[L, R\]** denotes the substring from **L**th to **R**th characters of the string **S**. 
In other words, you have to count number of pairs **(i, j)** of integers such that **L ≤ i ≤ j ≤ R** such that no character in substring **S\[i, j\]** occurs more than **K** times.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer **T**, denoting the number of test cases. Then **T** test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers **N**, **K** and **Q** as described in the problem. The second line contains a string **S** of length **N**. Then the next **Q** lines describe the query, where the **i**th line of them contains two space-separated integers **Li** and **Ri**.

### Output

For each query, print the required answer in a single line.

### Constraints and Subtasks

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 105**
- **1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105**
- **1 ≤ Q ≤ 105**
- **1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N**
- Sum of **N** over all test cases in one test file does not exceed **105**
- Sum of **Q** over all test cases in one test file does not exceed **105**
- **S** consists only of 0s and **1**s.

**Subtask 1: 10 points**

- Sum of **N** over all test cases in one test file does not exceed **100**

**Subtask 2: 10 points**

- **Q = 1**
- **1 ≤ K ≤ min(5, N)**

**Subtask 3: 20 points**

- **1 ≤ Q ≤ 10**

**Subtask 4: 60 points**

- Original constraints.

### Explanation

**Query 1:** Consider substring **P = S\[1, 4\] = "0111"**.
Out of **10** total substrings of **P**, substrings **P\[1, 4\]** and **P\[2, 4\]** are not valid because both contain more than two **1**s.
 Other substrings contains at most two 0s and at most two **1**s, thus the answer is **8**.

**Query 2:** Consider substring **P = S\[2, 4\] = "111"**.
Out of **6** total substrings of **P**, substrings **P\[1, 3\]** is not valid because it contains more than two 1s.

**Query 3:** Consider substring **P = S\[5, 8\] = "0000"**.
Out of **10** total substrings of **P**, substrings **P\[1, 3\]**, **P\[1, 4\]** and **P\[2, 4\]** are not valid because all contain more than two 0s.
