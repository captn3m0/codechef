### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/CHEFDQE.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/CHEFDQE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/CHEFDQE.pdf) as well.

Chef and one of his friends were practicing for ICPC together by giving each other programming problems.

In Chef's turn, Chef gave his friend a modified deque (double-ended queue), initially with $N$ elements $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$, which supported performing operations of the following type:
- Choose an integer $K$, which must be a power of $2$ (possibly $2^0 = 1$). Additionally, each particular value of $K$ can only be chosen if it has not been chosen in any previous operation.
- Delete $K$ elements from the end of the deque.
- Then, you may also decide to delete $K$ elements from the beginning of the deque.
- However, the deque is not allowed to become completely empty.

Chef also gave his friend a special integer $M$ and asked him to find the minimum number of operations needed such that the sum of the elements remaining in the deque is divisible by $M$, or determine that it is impossible to achieve this goal.

Chef's friend could not solve the problem and asked for your help. Can you solve it for him?
