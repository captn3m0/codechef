Refer to the figure below to understand what a Diamond shape is.\r\n\r\nThe Elric brothers come to Creta to learn this form of Alchemy. For this Alchemy, the energy from the earth is used to deconstruct and reconstruct. Now Edward is standing on a piece of land, which can be considered to be a grid of dimensions $N \\times N$. For every block of land, the energy it provides in Alchemy is given as $E_{ij}$. It is also possible for some block to have negative energy, in which case it reduces the power of transmutation diamond.\r\n\r\nThe power of transmutation from a diamond figure is the sum of the energies ( $E_{ij}$ ) of the blocks included in the transmutation diamond.   \r\n  \r\nGiven that the diamond figure must lie inside the grid, find the maximum power that can be generated from any diamond transmutation figure.
