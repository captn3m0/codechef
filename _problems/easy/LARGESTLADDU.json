This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$\n- $0 \\leq N \\leq 13$\n- $0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- Sum of $|A|$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/mandarin\/LARGESTLADDU.pdf) [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/vietnamese\/LARGESTLADDU.pdf), and [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/russian\/LARGESTLADDU.pdf)\n\nThis Diwali, Chef has decided to treat himself to a laddu feast. Chef's friends brought him some laddus, which he stored in an array $A$. **It is guaranteed that the length of $A$ is a power of $2$**. The $i^{th}$ element of the array $A$ is a laddu of size $A_i$. Chef would like to eat every laddu, but sadly he is on a diet and is allowed to eat only one laddu. He came up with a novel way to resolve this problem.\n\nChef performs the following steps in order:\n1. First, he pairs up every laddu from $A$ with some other laddu - if there are $N$ laddus in $A$, exactly $N\/2$ pairs are created, with each laddu being in exactly one of the pairs. Further, every pair $(x, y)$ must satisfy the condition $|x - y| \\leq 1$; in other words, the sizes of the laddus in each pair cannot differ by more than $1$.\n2. Next, for each pair of laddus $(x, y)$ formed in step $1$, mash them together to form a new laddu of size $x + y$. At the end of this process, Chef is left with exactly $N\/2$ laddus.\n3. Repeat the process with the $N\/2$ laddus he now has.\n\nAt any point in time, if Chef is unable to form $N\/2$ pairs (either because $N = 1$, or because there is no way to pair up laddus satisfying the condition on their sizes) he will immediately stop the process. \n\nIf there is only one laddu left in $A$ when the process stops, Chef considers his efforts to be a success; else he considers it a failure.\n\nPrint `\"YES\"` if there is a way for Chef to achieve success, else print `\"NO\"`.\n","inputFormat":"- The first line contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
