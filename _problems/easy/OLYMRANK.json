You are given the medal tally of $N$ of the participating countries. \n\nYou are also given $Q$ queries, each represented by a single integer $K$. For each such query, you need to find the best possible rank country $1$ can achieve if you are allowed to take **atmost** $K$ medals (possibly of different countries) and change their color.\n\n**Note**: \n- Countries are ranked lexicographically in order of their gold, silver, and bronze medals. If countries $i$ and $j$ have the same number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, then country $i$ is considered to be ahead of country $j$ if and only if $i \\lt j$. There are no ties in the rank list. \n- Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq B, S, G \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^8$\n- $0 \\leq K \\leq 10^{15}$\n- Sum of $N$ over all testcases is atmost $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n- Sum of $Q$ over all testcases is atmost $5 \\cdot 10^5$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (100 points):** Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/OCT21\/bengali\/OLYMRANK.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/OCT21\/mandarin\/OLYMRANK.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/OCT21\/russian\/OLYMRANK.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/OCT21\/vietnamese\/OLYMRANK.pdf) as well.\n\nThe Chef is at the Olympics.
