While preparing, he sees that the mint sauce is finished. He has to run upstairs to get it from other kitchen. Chef is currently on the $X^{th}$ stair. He has to climb all the way up to the $Y^{th}$ stair in minimum number of steps. In one step, Chef can do one of the following things: \n\n- Climb a single stair. ( i.e go from the $X^{th}$ stair to the $(X+1)^{th}$ stair. ) \n- Climb two stairs only if the final stair falls at a prime number position. ( i.e. go from the $X^{th}$ stair to the $(X+2)^{th}$ stair, only if $(X + 2$) is a prime number) \n\nHelp Chef reach the $Y^{th}$ stair from the $X^{th}$ stair in minimum number of steps. \n\n$\\textbf{See Explanation for more clarity.}$\n\n**Note:** The input files are large.
