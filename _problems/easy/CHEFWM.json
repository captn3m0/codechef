This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 500$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10^9$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Chef recently created a new Tiling Window Manager called ChefWM. He wants to find out the maximum number of columns of windows he can fit on the screen and he needs your help.\n\nConsider the screen to be an axis-aligned rectangle in the $xy$-plane, with its bottom-left corner at $(0, 0)$ and top-right corner at $(N, M)$ (that is, the screen has width $N$ units and height $M$ units). ChefWM works as follows:\n\n- First, the screen is divided into **one or more** columns of **equal integer width**.\n- Then, each column is divided into **two or more** windows of **equal integer height**. Note that all windows within a column must have the same height, but windows in different columns may have different heights.\n- Finally, Chef would like the following condition to hold:\n    - No two windows from different columns can have their horizontal boundary share the same $y$-coordinate (apart from $y = 0$ and $y = M$). See the figures below for more details.\n\nIt is not allowed to leave any empty space on the screen, i.e, the division performed in the first two steps above must cover the entire screen.\n\nHere is an example of a tiling that satisfies all the conditions, for $N = 8$ and $M = 6$.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/859058756524572672\/928178396071071784\/unknown.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" \/>\n\nBelow are two tilings that satisfy all conditions except the last. The one on the left has a horizontal edge at $y = 2$ in both columns, while the one on the right has a horizontal edge at $y = 2$ in column $1$ and column $3$.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/859058756524572672\/928178396280799292\/unknown.png\" width=\"265\"\/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/859058756524572672\/928197459228885033\/non-adjacent_violation.png\" width=\"225\"\/>\n\n\nWhat is the **maximum** number of *columns* that ChefWM can fit on the screen while following the above conditions? Note that you **do not need to maximize the number of windows**, you only need to maximize the number of columns.\n\nIt may be possible that no columns can be created under these conditions, in that case, print $0$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
