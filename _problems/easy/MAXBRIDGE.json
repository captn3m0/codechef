This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- $N-1 \\leq M \\leq \\min(N \\cdot (N-1)\/2, 10^5)$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases do not exceed $10^3$\n- Sum of $M$ over all test cases do not exceed $10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (100 points):** Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/MAXBRIDGE.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/MAXBRIDGE.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/MAXBRIDGE.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/MAXBRIDGE.pdf) as well.\n\nChef is given two integers $N$ and $M$.
