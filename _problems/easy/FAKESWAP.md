### Read problems statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/russian/FAKESWAP.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/bengali/FAKESWAP.pdf).

You are given two binary strings $S$ and $P$. You need to convert $S$ into $P$ using the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- Pick three binary values $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, such that at least one of them is equal to $1$ and at least one of them is equal to $0$. Then, pick three distinct indices $i$, $j$, and $k$, and assign $S_i=X$, $S_j=Y$, and $S_k=Z$.

Determine whether it's possible to convert $S$ into $P$.
