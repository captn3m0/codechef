### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME74/hindi/SFRV.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME74/bengali/SFRV.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME74/mandarin/SFRV.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME74/russian/SFRV.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME74/vietnamese/SFRV.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent elements of this sequence, i.e. $A_i$, $A_{i+1}$ for some valid $i$, and swap them. However, for each valid $i$, it is not allowed to choose $A_i$ (the element with the index $i$, regardless of its value at any point in time) more than once in total during this process.

Find the maximum of the sum $S = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \cdot i$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum possible value of $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $N \le 20$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
4
2 1 4 3
4
7 6 3 2
```

### Example Output
```
30
39
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Swap the first and second element of the initial sequence. Then, swap the third and fourth element of the resulting sequence. The final sequence $A$ is $(1, 2, 3, 4)$.

**Example case 2:** Swap the second and third element to make the sequence $(7, 3, 6, 2)$.
