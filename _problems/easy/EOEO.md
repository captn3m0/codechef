As usual, Tom and Jerry are fighting. Tom has strength $TS$ and Jerry has strength $JS$. You are given $TS$ and your task is to find the number of possible values of $JS$ such that Jerry wins the following game.

The game consists of one or more turns. In each turn:
- If both $TS$ and $JS$ are even, their values get divided by $2$ and the game proceeds with the next turn.
- If both $TS$ and $JS$ are odd, a tie is declared and the game ends.
- If $TS$ is even and $JS$ is odd, Tom wins the game.
- If $TS$ is odd and $JS$ is even, Jerry wins the game.

Find the number of possible initial values of $JS$ such that $1 \le JS \le TS$, there is no tie and Jerry wins the game.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $TS$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of values of $JS$ such that Jerry wins the game.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le TS \le 10^{18}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $T, TS \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1
11
```

### Example Output
```
0
5
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We must have $JS = TS = 1$, but in this case, the game ends and a tie is declared in the first turn.

**Example case 2:** If $JS \in \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$, then $JS$ is even and $TS$ is odd, so Jerry wins the game in the first turn. Any odd value of $JS$ leads to a tie instead.
