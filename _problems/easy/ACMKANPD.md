 <a id="x1-5r4" name="x1-5r4"></a> D A New Number System Input file:stdinOutput file:stdout





As we know, in an n-based number system, there are n different types of digits. In this way, a 1-based number system has only 1 type of digit, the ‘0’. Here are the rules to interpret 1-based numbers. Each number consists of some space separated blocks of 0. A block may have 1, 2 or more 0s. There is a ‘flag’ variable associated with each number

- A block with a single 0 sets ‘flag’ variable to 1
- A block with two 0s sets the ‘flag’ to 0
- If there are n (n &gt; 2) 0s in a block, n-2 binary digits with the current value of flag is appended to your number.

Note that, the first block of every number will have at most 2 0s. For example, the 1-base number 0 0000 00 000 0 0000 is equivalent to binary 11011.

- 1st block sets the flag to 1.
- 2nd block has 4 0s. So append flag(= 1) 4 - 2 = 2 times (11).
- 3rd block has 2 0s. Set the flag to 0
- 4th block has 3 0s. Append flag(= 0) 3 − 2 = 1 time (110).
- 5th block has a single 0. Set flag = 1
- 6th and block has 4 0s. Append flag(= 0) 4 − 2 = 2 times (11011).

The final binary number wont have more than 30 digits. Once, youve completed the process, convert the binary value to decimal &amp; print, youre done!

Input

Input will have at most 100 test cases. Each case consists of a 1-based number as described above. A number may be spanned to multiple lines but a single block will always be in a single line. Termination of a case will be indicated by a single ‘#’ char which will be space-separated from the last digit of your input number. The last case in the input is followed by a ‘∼’ character indicating, end of input.

Output

For each test case, output a single line with the decimal equivalent value of your given 1-based number.
