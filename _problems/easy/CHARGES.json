Since all the particles have a similar charge, each is separated from the previous by a distance of $2$ units. So the location of particle $3$ is $2 + 2 = 4$ units from the first particle.\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** After reversing the parity of particle $1$, the new configuration is $100$. Here, the charges of particles $1$ and $2$ differ, so they are separated by $1$ unit. The charges of particles $2$ and $3$ agree, so they are separated by $2$ units. So, the location of particle $3$ is $1 + 2 = 3$ units from the first particle.\r\n\r\n**Update 3:** After reversing the charge of particle $3$, the new configuration is $101$. Here, particles $1$ and $2$ are separated by $1$ unit and particles $2$ and $3$ are separated by $1$ unit. So the location of particle $3$ is $1 + 1 = 2$ units from the first particle.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME96\/bengali\/CHARGES.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME96\/mandarin\/CHARGES.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME96\/russian\/CHARGES.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME96\/vietnamese\/CHARGES.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nThere are $N$ subatomic particles lined up in a row.
