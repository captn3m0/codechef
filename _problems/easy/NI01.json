{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"NI01","problem_name":"Jurassic Park","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p style=\"text-align:justify\">A Jurassic Park consists of a dinosaur museum and a park for safari riding. There are many passengers and <b>n<\/b> single-passenger cars. Passengers wander around the museum for a while and then line up at the park gate to take a ride in a safari car. Note that each passenger is allowed for one ride only. When a car is available, it loads the one passenger it can hold and rides the park for a specific amount of time say <b>p<\/b>. If all the <b>n<\/b> cars are out riding passengers around, then a passenger who wants a ride waits; if a car is ready to load but there are no waiting passengers, then the car waits. After every <b>r<\/b> units of time one passenger from the museum gets ready to take the safari car ride. Assume that the Jurassic Park is open for <b>k<\/b> units of time. Write a program to find the status of the passengers and safari cars after <b>k<\/b> units of time.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The input to this program is the total number of safari cars available in the park n <b>(0 \u2264 n \u2264 50)<\/b>. The number of passengers wandering in the museum m <b>(0 \u2264 m \u2264 5000)<\/b> and the number of passengers q <b>(0 \u2264 q \u2264 100)<\/b> in the park gate ready to take a ride in the park at time zero. The other inputs are the values of p <b>(1 \u2264 p \u2264 100)<\/b>, r <b>(1 \u2264 r \u2264 100)<\/b> and k <b>(r \u2264 k \u2264 100000)<\/b>.
