This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2000$\n- $20 \\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- The sum of $N$ over all testcases does not exceed $5000$\n- $|A| = |B| = N$\n- $A$ and $B$ are binary strings, i.e, contain only $0$ and $1$.\n- At most $N$ moves can be made for each testcase.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask #1 (100 pts)**: original constraints","subtasksState":false,"statement":"*This problem is similar to the problem `\"STRFLIP2\"`.

Every string in the actual test files will have a length of at least $20$, as stated by the constraints.\n\n**Test Case $1$:** The given string is $A = 10110$. Apart from the single character substrings and the substring $A[3:4] = 11$, all other substrings are valid first moves.\n\nThe sample output performs moves as follows:\n- First, flip the substring $A[1:4]$. Now, $A = 01000$.\n- Then, flip the substring $A[2:3]$. Now, $A = 00100$, which is the target string.\n\nNote that there are several other valid solutions, and any solution using no more than $5$ moves will be accepted. For example, a sequence of $3$ moves is shown below:\n- Flip $A[1:5]$, giving $A = 01001$\n- Flip $A[4:5]$, giving $A = 01010$\n- Flip $A[2:4]$, giving $A = 00100$\n\n**Test Case 2:** The given string $A = 00000$ has no substring with both $0$ and $1$, consequently there are no moves possible. Therefore it is impossible to convert this string to $B = 11111$.\n\n**Test Case 3:** The given string $A = 00$ is already equal to $B$ and so no moves are required.","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"utkarsh_adm","problem_author_html_handle":"utkarsh_adm","problem_tester":"aryanc403","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>aryanc403<\/span>","date_added":"16-01-2022","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/constructive'>constructive<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/medium'>medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/start22'>start22<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/utkarsh_adm'>utkarsh_adm<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/STRFLIP","time":{"view_start_date":1642613400,"submit_start_date":1642613400,"visible_start_date":1642613400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797887},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=STRFLIP","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
