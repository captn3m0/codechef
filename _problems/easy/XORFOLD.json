Each cell of this grid contains either $0$ or $1$.\n\nWe should perform the following operation until the size of the grid becomes $1 \\times 1$:\n- Suppose the present size of the grid is $x \\times y$.\n- Choose one of the $x-1$ horizontal lines or $y-1$ vertical lines crossing the grid.\n- Fold the grid along this line. For each pair of cells which overlap after this folding, replace them by a single cell such that the value in this cell is the XOR of the values in the two overlapping cells. Thus, we obtain a new grid.\n\n**Example:** If the initial grid is\n```\n000\n111\n010\n```\n\n1) After folding along $1$-st horizontal line, the grid is\n```\n111\n010\n```\n\n2) After folding along the $2$-nd vertical line, the grid is\n```\n10\n01\n```\n\n3) After folding along the $1$-st horizontal line, the grid is\n```\n11\n```\n\n4) After folding along the $1$-st vertical line, the grid is\n```\n0\n```\n\nDetermine whether there is a sequence of folds such that in the final $1 \\times 1$ grid, the only cell contains $1$.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a single binary string $S_i$ with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of the grid.\n\n### Output\nPrint a single line containing the string `\"YES\"` if it is possible to obtain $1$ in the final $1 \\times 1$ grid or `\"NO\"` if it is impossible (without quotes).\n\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will all be treated as identical).\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\cdot M \\leq 10^5$\n- each character of each string is '0' or '1'\n- the sum of $N \\cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n1 2\n01\n3 3\n000\n111\n010\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\nYES\nNO\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** There is only $1$ possible move, which is to fold along the only vertical line. The resulting grid contains only $1$.\n\n**Example case 2:** There is no sequence of moves which would result in a $1 \\times 1$ grid containing only $1$.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK130\/mandarin\/XORFOLD.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK130\/russian\/XORFOLD.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK130\/vietnamese\/XORFOLD.pdf) and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK130\/bengali\/XORFOLD.pdf) as well.\n\nYou are given a grid with size $N \\times M$.
