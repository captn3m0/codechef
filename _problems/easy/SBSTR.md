Let's call a string $X$ *interesting* if it satisfies the following conditions:
- $X$ contains at least $K$ pairwise distinct characters
- for any two characters $c_1$ and $c_2$ which appear in $X$, the frequency (number of occurrences) of $c_1$ in $X$ is equal to the frequency of $c_2$ in $X$

You are given a string $S$. Compute the number of interesting substrings of $S$. Two substrings are considered different if they are located at different positions in $S$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a string $S$, followed by a space and and integer $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of interesting substrings.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le |S| \le 7,000$
- the sum of $|S|$ in all test cases does not exceed $14,000$
- $|S|$ contains only lowercase English letters
- $0 \le K \le 26$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $1 \le |S| \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (20 points):**
- $1 \le |S| \le 1,000$
- the sum of $|S|$ in all test cases does not exceed $2,000$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
ababc 2
```

### Example Output
```
6
```
	
### Explanation

**Example case 1:** The interesting substrings are "ab", "ba", "ab", "bc", "abab" and "abc".
