Chef has a new customer and he wants to prepare his order as soon as possible. While preparing, he sees that the mint sauce is finished. He has to run upstairs to get it from other kitchen. Chef is currently on the $X^{th}$ stair. He has to climb all the way up to the $Y^{th}$ stair in minimum number of steps. In one step, Chef can do one of the following things: 

- Climb a single stair. ( i.e go from the $X^{th}$ stair to the $(X+1)^{th}$ stair. ) 
- Climb two stairs only if the final stair falls at a prime number position. ( i.e. go from the $X^{th}$ stair to the $(X+2)^{th}$ stair, only if $(X + 2$) is a prime number) 

Help Chef reach the $Y^{th}$ stair from the $X^{th}$ stair in minimum number of steps. 

$\textbf{See Explanation for more clarity.}$

**Note:** The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.
