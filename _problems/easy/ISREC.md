### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CCRC2021/hindi/ISREC.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CCRC2021/mandarin/ISREC.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CCRC2021/vietnamese/ISREC.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CCRC2021/bengali/ISREC.pdf) as well.

You are given a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'. 

Find out whether all the cells containing '1'-s form a rectangle, I.e, is there a rectangular contiguous subgrid such that every cell within it is a '1', and all the cells containing '1'-s are within this subgrid.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of the grid.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"YES"` if the connected component of '1'-s is a rectangle or `"NO"` if it is not.

**Note:** The output is case-insensitive â€• each letter may be printed in upper case or lower case.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1000$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 500$
- Sum of $N*M$ over all tests is atmost $1.5*10^6$
- Each string contains only characters '0' and '1'
- It is guaranteed that grid contains at least a single '1'

### Example Input
```
3
3 3
010
111
010
4 4
0000
0110
1110
1100
3 3
011
011
000
```

### Example Output
```
NO
NO
YES
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The minimal rectangle which covers all '1'-s also covers $4$ cells which contain '0'-s.

**Example case 2:** The minimal rectangle which covers all '1'-s also covers $2$ cells which contain '0'-s.

**Example case 3:** We can form a minimal rectangle with side length $2$ which covers all cells containing '1'-s and none of the cells containing '0'-s.
