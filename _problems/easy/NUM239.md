Vasya likes the number $239$. Therefore, he considers a number *pretty* if its last digit is $2$, $3$ or $9$. 

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between $L$ and $R$ (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of pretty numbers between $L$ and $R$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1 10
11 33
```

### Example Output
```
3
8
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The pretty numbers between $1$ and $10$ are $2$, $3$ and $9$.

**Example case 2:** The pretty numbers between $11$ and $33$ are $12$, $13$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $29$, $32$ and $33$.
