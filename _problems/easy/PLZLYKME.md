All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN14/mandarin/PLZLYKME.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JAN14/russian/PLZLYKME.pdf).

 In a far away dystopian world, the measure of the quality of a person’s life is the numbers of likes he gets for an article about their life. For a person to stay alive, he has to acquire at least **L** number of likes before **D** days pass.

 People in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a constant factor **C**.

So if one starts with **S** likes on Day-1, he would have **D2** = **S + C \* S** likes on Day-2, **D3 = D2 + D2 \* C** on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would survive at the end of Day-D or not.

 **Input**

 First line contains a single positive integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The following **T** lines represent a test case each. Each test case contains 4 space-separated integers **L, D, S and C**.

 **Output**

For each test case, print a single line containing “**ALIVE AND KICKING**” if the person would live, otherwise print, “**DEAD AND ROTTING**”.

 **Constraints**

**1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000**

**1 &lt;= L &lt;= 1000000000**

**1 &lt;= D &lt;= 1000000000**

**1 &lt;= S &lt;= 1000000000**

**1 &lt;= C &lt;= 1000000000**

**Sample cases:**

<pre>
<b>Input</b>
2
5 1 5 1
10 2 2 2

<b>Output</b>
ALIVE AND KICKING
DEAD AND ROTTING
</pre>
**Explanation**

In the first case by the end of Day-1 we would be having **S** that is **5** number of likes, as it is ≥ **L**, the answer is **ALIVE AND KICKING**.

In the second case, **D2 =S + C\*S**, therefore **D2 = 2 + 2 \* 2 = 6**, as 6 is less than 10, the answer is **DEAD AND ROTTING**.
