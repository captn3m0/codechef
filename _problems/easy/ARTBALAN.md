"Everything in the universe is balanced. Every disappointment you face in life will be balanced by something good for you! Keep going, never give up."

Let's call a string *balanced* if all characters that occur in this string occur in it the same number of times.

You are given a string $S$; this string may only contain uppercase English letters. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose one letter in $S$ and replace it by another uppercase English letter. Note that even if the replaced letter occurs in $S$ multiple times, only the chosen occurrence of this letter is replaced.

Find the minimum number of operations required to convert the given string to a balanced string.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of operations.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10,000$
- $1 \le |S| \le 1,000,000$
- the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000,000$
- $S$ contains only uppercase English letters

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):**
- $T \le 10$
- $|S| \le 18$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
ABCB
BBC
```

### Example Output
```
1
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We can change 'C' to 'A'. The resulting string is "ABAB", which is a balanced string, since the number of occurrences of 'A' is equal to the number of occurrences of 'B'.

**Example case 2:** We can change 'C' to 'B' to make the string "BBB", which is a balanced string.
