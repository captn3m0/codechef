A *directed tree* is a directed graph such that if all edges were undirected, this graph would be a tree. A *rooted directed tree* is a directed tree in which there is one vertex (the *root*, let's denote it by $r$) such that it is possible to reach all vertices of the graph from $r$ by moving along the directed edges.

You are given a directed tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). You may perform the following operation on it any number of times (including zero):
- Choose some edge which currently exists in the graph.
- Remove this edge.
- Add a new edge in such a way that the graph becomes a directed tree again.

What is the smallest number of operations which need to be performed in order to make the directed tree rooted?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that there is a directed edge from $u$ to $v$ in the tree.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest number of operations we need to perform to create a rooted directed tree.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^4$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- the graph described on the input is a directed tree
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** for each edge, $u = 1$ or $v = 1$ (the graph is a directed star)

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
3
1 2
3 2
3
1 2
2 3
```

### Example Output
```
1
0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We can delete the edge from vertex $3$ to vertex $2$ and insert an edge from $3$ to $1$. Then, the graph becomes a rooted directed tree with vertex $3$ as the root. However, there are many other possible solutions.

**Example case 2:** The graph is already a rooted directed tree; the root is vertex $1$.
