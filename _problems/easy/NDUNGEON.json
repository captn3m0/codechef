{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p> Nikhil has designed the following game. The game is played in a\nset of rooms in a dungeon, arranged in an <em>M    N<\/em>\nrectangular grid. In one of the rooms, the evil wazir has imprisoned\nthe princess. The noble prince is on his way to rescue the\nprincess.<\/p>\n\n<p>The prince starts in the room at the top left corner of the grid,\nwhich is labelled (1,1).  Each room contains some guards.  It takes a\ncertain amount of time before the prince can kill all the guards in\nthe room he is in.  The time taken to kill the guards varies from room\nto room.  Once he has killed all the guards in a room, he can move on\nto any one of its neighbours by going left, right, up or down,\nprovided, of course, that there is a neighbouring room in the\ncorresponding direction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The wazir, knowing that the prince is on his way, has set a time\nbomb that will kill the princess after <em>T<\/em> seconds.  You will\nbe given the position of the princess, the time left for the bomb to\ngo off and the time it takes for the prince to kill the guards in each\nof the rooms in the dungeon.  Your task is to determine if it is\npossible for the prince to reach the princess and save her by defusing\nthe bomb before the <em>T<\/em> seconds expire.<\/p>\n\n<p> For example, suppose the dungeon is described by the following\ngrid of numbers.<\/p>\n\n<pre>2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>The number at position <em>(i,j)<\/em> indicates the time taken for\nthe prince to overpower the guards in room <em>(i,j)<\/em>. Suppose the\nprincess is in the room at position (4,2). If <em>T<\/em> = 10.  there\nis no way the prince can reach the princess in time. However, if\n<em>M<\/em> = 15, the prince can reach the princess with 4 seconds to\nspare, as follows.  Starting from (1,1), he moves right to (1,2) and\nthen (1,3), comes down all the way to (4,3) and then moves (4,2).  This\ntakes 11 seconds (note that he must also overpower the guard in the\nroom where the princess is incarcerated). You can check that he cannot\nreach the princess with more than 4 seconds to spare by any route.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains two integers M and N indicating the number of rows and columns in the rectangular dungeon. Lines 2,3,   ,M+1 contain N positive integers. The jth integer on line i+1 is the time taken to overpower the guards at room (i,j). The last line in the input, line M+2, contains three integers a, b and T, where (a,b) is the position of the cell where the princess is held and T is the amount of time before the bomb goes off.\n\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nIf it is not possible for the prince to save the princess then print a single line with the answer NO. Otherwise, print two lines. The first line should say YES. The second line should contain a single integer indicating the maximum possible time to spare when the prince rescues the princess.\n\n<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p>\nYou may assume that 1     N,K     70.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n4 3 \n2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n4 2 15\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nYES\n4\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"NDUNGEON","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"NDUNGEON"}
