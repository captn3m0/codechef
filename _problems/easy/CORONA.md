### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START9/mandarin/CORONA.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START9/bengali/CORONA.pdf).

There are $N$ cities (numbered from $1$ to $N$) and $M$ bidirectional roads. The $i^{th}$ of these roads connects the cities $A_i$ and $B_i$ and has a length of $D_i$ Km.

There are only $K$ cities that have a hospital for corona testing. The cost of corona testing may be different in different cities. For each city, we want to know the minimum cost that needs to be spent to test a corona sample. If city you are in contains a hospital and you choose to test in that hospital itself, then the cost incurred is the cost of corona test in that hospital. Otherwise, if you choose to test in a hospital in another city, then an additional transportation cost is also incurred (Assuming Rs.1 per Km).

So from a city $i$, if you choose to send a sample to city $j$, then the total cost incurred will be $C_j + D(i,j)$. Here $C_j$ denotes the cost of corona testing in a hospital situated in city $j$ and $D(i,j)$ denotes the minimum distance between city $i$ and $j$ via some road network.

Output the *minimum* money that should be spent by a person in each of the $N$ cities for testing a corona sample.

It is guaranteed that there is a path from every city to every other city. Also, there is at most one road between any pair of cities (i.e. no multiple edges). There are no roads from one city to itself (i.e. no self-loops).

**Note:** Since the inputs and outputs are large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
