### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/hindi/CIRMERGE.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/bengali/CIRMERGE.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/mandarin/CIRMERGE.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/russian/CIRMERGE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY19/vietnamese/CIRMERGE.pdf) as well.

$N$ integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid $i$, $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$ are adjacent, and $A_1$ and $A_N$ are also adjacent.

We want to repeat the following operation exactly $N-1$ times (until only one number remains):
- Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by $a$ and $b$.
- Score $a+b$ penalty points.
- Erase both $a$ and $b$ from the circle and insert $a+b$ in the space between them.

What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of penalty points.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $2 \le N \le 400$
- $1 \le a_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $2 \le N \le 10$
- $a_i \le 10$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (10 points):**
- $2 \le N \le 25$
- $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$ are distinct powers of $2$ (including $1$)

**Subtask #3 (10 points):** $2 \le N \le 100$

**Subtask #4 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3
10 10 1
```

### Example Output
```
32
```

### Explanation

- $[10,10,1] \rightarrow [10, 11]$, penalty:  $11$
- $[10,11] \rightarrow [21]$, penalty:  $21$
- Total penalty: $11+21=32$
