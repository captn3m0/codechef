{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"DLTNODE","problem_name":"Sardar and GCD","body":"Sardar Khan has finally decided to attack Ramadhir. He will be bombing one of Ramadhir's business in Wasseypur. Sardar Khan knows that in total Ramadhir has $N$ businesses (numbered $1$ to $N$) and that there are $N - 1$ roads connecting these businesses in such a way that all businesses are connected. Each business has a specific value that Sardar Khan knows. \n\nAll of Ramadhir's businesses are interlinked to each other in a unique way. If Sardar Khan destroys one of his business, then along with that business all the roads emerging from that business also get destroyed in the process and the damage caused to Ramadhir will be equal to sum of the greatest common divisors of all the values of the businesses that are still connected to each other.\nRefer to sample test cases for more explanation.\n\nSardar Khan obviously wants to maximize the damage he causes. Can you help him find the maximum amount of damage he can do?\n\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases will not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n- It is guaranteed that the given roads connect every business.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Sardar Khan has finally decided to attack Ramadhir - he will bomb one of Ramadhir's businesses in Wasseypur. Sardar Khan knows that Ramadhir has $N$ businesses (numbered $1$ to $N$) and that there are $N - 1$ roads connecting pairs of these businesses in such a way that all businesses are connected. Further, Sardar knows that each business has a specific value - the $i$-th business has value $A_i$.\n\nWhen Sardar Khan destroys a business, he also destroys every road directly connected to it.\nFormally, destroying business $v$ also destroys all existing roads of the form $(u, v)$.\n\nSardar thinks that the damage dealt to Ramadhir upon destroying business $v$ equals the sum of the [greatest common divisors](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Greatest_common_divisor) of every remaining maximal connected set of businesses. More formally,\n* Let the connected components of the graph obtained on deleting $v$ and edges incident to it be $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k$.\n* Define $\\gcd(C_i)$ to be $\\gcd(A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\dots, A_{i_r})$ where $C_i$ consists of vertices $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_r$.\n* The damage caused by destroying $v$ is then $\\sum_{i = 1}^k \\gcd(C_i)$.\n\nSardar Khan wants to maximize the damage he deals.

This gives a damage of $\\gcd(A_1, A_3, A_4, A_5) = 1$.\n* If business $3$ is bombed, the remaining connected components are $\\{(1, 2), (4), (5)\\}$. This gives a damage of $\\gcd(A_1, A_2) + \\gcd(A_4) + \\gcd(A_5) = 2 + 12 + 15 = 29$.\n* If business $4$ is bombed, the remaining connected components are $\\{(1, 2, 3, 5)\\}$.
