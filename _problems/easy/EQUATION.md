### Statement

Given N,A,B,C, find how many solutions exist to the equation : a + b + c ≤ N, such that 0 ≤ a ≤ A, 0 ≤ b ≤ B, 0 ≤ c ≤ C.

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (1&lt;= T &lt;= 50). Each test case contains 4 integers, N,A,B,C. 0 ≤ N,A,B,C ≤ 2500

### Output

Output T lines, one for each test case.
