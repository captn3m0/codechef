Therefore, every now and then, Chef asks Chefu about the current scores of the teams and Chefu tells him the score. However, Chefu sometimes does not specify the teams along with the score \u2014 for example, he could say \"the score is 3 to 6\", and there is no way to know just from this statement if it was their favourite team or the other team that scored 6 goals; in different statements, the order of teams may also be different. Other times, Chefu specifies which team scored how many goals.\r\n\r\nChef asks for the score and receives a reply $N$ times. There are two types of replies:\r\n- `1 A B`: their favourite team scored $A$ goals and the other team scored $B$ goals\r\n- `2 A B`: one team scored $A$ goals and the other scored $B$ goals\r\n\r\nChef is asking you to help him determine the score of his favourite team after each of Chefu's replies. After each reply, based on the current reply and all previous information (but without any following replies), tell him whether it is possible to certainly determine the number of goals scored by his favourite team.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
