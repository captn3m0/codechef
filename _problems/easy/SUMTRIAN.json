{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3>\n<p>\nLet's consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line, three in the third line, etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;<\/li>\n<li> the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100 <\/li>\n<li> all numbers are positive integers between O and 99.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nIn the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000).<br \/>\nThen n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case write the determined value in a separate line. <\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3\n1\n2 1\n1 2 3\n4 \n1 \n1 2 \n4 1 2\n2 3 1 1 \n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n5\n9\n<\/pre><p><br\/><br \/>\n<b>Warning: large Input\/Output data, be careful with certain languages<\/b> <\/br\/><\/p>\n    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"SUMTRIAN","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"SUMTRIAN"}
