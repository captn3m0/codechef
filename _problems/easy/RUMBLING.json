Eren Yeager who possesses the Founding Titan has decided to begin The Rumbling to show the true power of the Eldians to the rest of the world.\n\n- There are $N$ Titans standing in a line from west to east. Each of the Titans is facing one of the four directions i.e., North, South, East, or West, represented by uppercase English letters 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' respectively.\n\n- A Titan can **rotate** on the spot where it is standing. It requires $X$ units of energy to rotate $90$ degrees clockwise, and  $Y$ units of energy to rotate $90$ degrees anti-clockwise.\n\n- For the activation of The Rumbling, all the Titans must face Eren Yeager.\n\nSo, Eren wants to position himself on the West-East line (on which other Titans are standing). He can either stand to the left of all Titans, in between two consecutive Titans, or to the right of all Titans. He wants to choose a position that minimizes the units of energy required by all the Titans to rotate and face him. Find the minimum units of energy required by all the Titans for the Activation of the Rumbling in the optimal configuration.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2 * 10^{5}$\n- $1 \\leq X, Y \\leq 10^{9}$\n- $S$ contains characters from {'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'} only.\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"The Rumbling is a hypothetical cataclysmic event involving Karl Fritz's Wall Titans marching across the Earth, destroying all life upon it.
