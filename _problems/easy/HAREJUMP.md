<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>The chef got a new rabbit and he is going to train him so that he can perform for him whenever he needs entertainment. The chef teaches k types of jumps to the rabbit. Each jump has definite length L units. The rabbit does not have any brains he will use any type of jump he feels like at any point of time. He is placed on a very long mat and starts at 0 unit. The chef wants to know in how many ways he can perform his jumps and cover exactly N units of distance.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains the number of the test cases T(&lt;=100). Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line defines the distance N (1&lt;=N&lt;=10^18) which tells us the number of units the chef wants the rabbit to cover. The next line contains k the number of jumps which are taught to the rabbit, k (k&lt;=15) integers follow in the same line each denoting distinct distance L (L&lt;=15) units which can be jumped by the rabbit.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print T integers each denoting the number of ways the rabbit can perform jumps of N units of distance. Print the remainder obtained on dividing the answer by 1000000007 if the answer is greater than or equal to 1000000007.</p>
