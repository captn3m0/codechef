### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/mandarin/SUBLCS.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/bengali/SUBLCS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/russian/SUBLCS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/vietnamese/SUBLCS.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Consider **every** pair that consists of:

$1)$ One of the **longest** non-decreasing subsequences of $A$.

$2)$ One of the **longest** non-increasing subsequences of $A$. 

Find the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of the two sequences in such a pair.
