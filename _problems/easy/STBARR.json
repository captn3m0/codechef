This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 100$ for each valid $i$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"$  \\textit {Life is change, change is stability.} $\n\nChef calls a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ `stable` if all the elements in the sequence are equal.\n\nChef gives you a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$. You may perform the following operations on the sequence any number of times (possibly $0$):\n1. Select any prefix $A[1 \\ldots k]$ such that $max(A[1 \\ldots k]) = A[k]$ and set $A[i] := A[k]$ $\\forall i \\in [1,k-1]$. For example, if the sequence $ A = [\\textcolor{blue}{3,1,4},5,9] $, then choosing $k = 3$ yields the sequence $ [\\textcolor{blue}{4,4,4},5,9] $.\n\n2. Select any segment $A[L \\ldots R]$ and shift the segment cyclically to the left keeping other elements unchanged. For example, if the sequence $ A = [3, \\textcolor{blue}{4,1,5} ,9] $, then choosing $L = 2$ and $R = 4$ yields the sequence $[3, \\textcolor{blue}{1,5,4} ,9]$.\n\nChef is asking you to find the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence `stable`.\n\nIt is guaranteed that you can always make the sequence `stable` using such operations.","inputFormat":"- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
