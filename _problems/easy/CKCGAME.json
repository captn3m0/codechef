Both players can move like a chess king on the grid: one step horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can't move out of the grid or stay in the same cell. \n\nAlice starts with an initial score of $0$. The game proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Alice moves to a neighboring cell of her choice (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Her score increases by the integer on the cell she just moved to.\n2. If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else Bob moves to a neighboring cell of his choice.\n3. If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else go to step 1.\n\nThe goal of Alice is to maximize her score. The goal of Bob is to minimize Alice's score. Both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end in a finite number of iterations.\n\nYou need to find the maximum score Alice can achieve. \n\n**Note**: Over the course of the game, Alice can revisit cells multiple times.

Bob then moves to $(1, 2)$ and catches Alice. This is the optimal gameplay.\n\n- For the second test case, Alice moves to $(3, 3)$ and gets $10$ points. Bob moves to $(2, 2)$. Then Alice moves to $(4,4)$ and gets another $10$ points. Bob them moves to $(3, 3)$. Finally, Alice moves to $(3, 3)$ gaining a total of $30$ points. The game ends as Alice and Bob are in the same cell.
