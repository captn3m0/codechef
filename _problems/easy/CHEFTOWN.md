All submissions for this problem are available.ChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1

3. Imagine, that we have a segment \[L,R\].
4. Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.
5. Let's sort B in non-decreasing order.
6. Segment \[L,R\] is interesting if B\[i\]-B\[i-1\]=1 for every i (2 Now the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades (\[L1,R1\] and \[L2,R2\]) are considered to be different, if L1≠L2 or R1≠R2.
    
    ### Input
