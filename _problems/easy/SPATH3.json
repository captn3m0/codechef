Formally, if you are at the cell $(i,j)$ of the grid, you can go to either of the cells $(i + 1, j)$, $(i, j - 1)$, $(i - 1, j)$ or $(i, j + 1)$ at a cost of $X$.\r\n- Go diagonally down-left, down-right, up-left, up-right, for a cost of $Y$. Formally, if you are at the cell $(i,j)$ of the grid, you can go to either of the cells $(i + 1, j - 1)$, $(i + 1, j + 1)$, $(i - 1, j - 1)$ or $(i - 1, j + 1)$ at a cost of $Y$.\r\n\r\nYou cannot exit the grid at any point.
