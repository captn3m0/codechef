This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1200$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\le A_i \\le N$\n- $1 \\leq X,K \\leq N$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3\\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Chef was on vacation when a thought struck him.

If there are multiple answers, you can output **any** configuration; and if there is no possible answer, output $-1$.\n\n**Note:** The MEX of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in it. For example,\n- The MEX of array $[0,2,5,1]$ is $3,$ because it contains $0, 1$ and $2$ but not $3$.\n- The MEX of array $[1,2,5]$ is $0,$ because $0$ is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.\n- The MEX of array $[0,1,2,3]$ is $4$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
