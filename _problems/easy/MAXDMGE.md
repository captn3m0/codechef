Sardar Khan with two of his henchmen are planning to attack $N$ shops of the Qureshi's, lined up closely numbered from $1$ to $N$. Each of the $N$ shops contains some $A_i$ kg of Coal in them. The coal in each shop would amplify the explosion, allowing the flames to reach other shops too. 

Unfortunately, all his bombs are in the locker except $1$ and they have lost the key. Sardar asks Nasir to calculate which shop should be attacked for maximum damage.
Net Damage caused due to bombing on the $i_{th}$ shop is dependent on the amount of coal in the shops in a unique way. Net damage caused by the bombing of the $i_{th}$ shop is the value of the $Bitwise &$ of all elements in a given subarray of shops that must include the $i_{th}$ shop. For each shop, Nasir will choose a subarray that maximizes the net damage and has a size greater than $1$. $Bitwise &$ of a subarray is basically defined as $Bitwise &$ of all the coal present in that subarray of shops.

Nasir being illiterate is weak in maths and devising strategies. So you have to help Nasir and tell him the (maximum) net damage for each shop.
