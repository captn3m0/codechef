### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/hindi/MSV.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/bengali/MSV.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/mandarin/MSV.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/russian/MSV.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/vietnamese/MSV.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. For each valid $i$, the *star value* of the element $A_i$ is the number of valid indices $j \lt i$ such that $A_j$ is divisible by $A_i$.

Chef is a curious person, so he wants to know the maximum star value in the given sequence. Help him find it.

### Input
-  The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ .
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum star value.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$   
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100,000$.
### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** sum  of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
7
8 1 28 4 2 6 7
```

### Example Output
```
3
```

### Explanation
$A_5 = 2$ divides $4$, $28$ and $8$, so its star value is $3$. There is no element with a higher star value.
