The junctions are depicted below and they form a hexagonal grid \u2014 they satisfy the following conditions:\r\n- Two of the junctions have coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$.\r\n- Each junction $J$ is connected by line segments with six other junctions. These junctions are the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length $1$ and their distances from $J$ are also all equal to $1$.\r\n\r\n![](https:\/\/codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com\/download\/Images\/COOK112\/ROBOTS\/ROBOTS.png)\r\n\r\nChef created a robot that can traverse the junctions. Initially, it is in some junction and oriented towards another junction which is connected to it by a line segment. The robot accepts a string of instructions \u2014 decimal digits $0$ through $5$. It executes the instructions one by one and stops after executing the final instruction. When the robot executes an instruction denoted by a digit $d$, it first rotates by $60 \\cdot d$ degrees counterclockwise and then moves $1$ unit forward, to the junction it is oriented towards.\r\n\r\nChef wants to test the robot, so he wrote a string $S$ of $N$ instructions. You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, Chef wants to give the robot a substring of instructions $S_L, S_{L+1}, \\ldots, S_R$; the robot starts in the junction $(0, 0)$ and it is oriented towards $(1, 0)$. You should find the final position (the $x$- and $y$-coordinates) of the robot.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.\r\n- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.\r\n- $Q$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$ describing a query.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated real numbers \u2014 the coordinates of the robot. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of each coordinate does not exceed $10^{-6}$.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Outputting more than 8 digits after floating point may result in exceeding output size limit and receiving \"Runtime error\" verdict.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\r\n- $1 \\le N, Q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\le L \\le R \\le N$\r\n- $S$ contains only characters '0', '1', '2', '3', '4' and '5'\r\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\r\n- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n1\r\n3 3\r\n012\r\n1 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n1.00000000 0.00000000\r\n1.50000000 0.86602540\r\n0.50000000 0.86602540\r\n```\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK112\/hindi\/ROBOTS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK112\/mandarin\/ROBOTS.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK112\/russian\/ROBOTS.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK112\/vietnamese\/ROBOTS.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK112\/bengali\/ROBOTS.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nChefland is a big city which consists of infinite number of junctions on a 2D plane.
