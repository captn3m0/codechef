They have seen a lot: prosperity and hunger, tranquility and rebellions, live and death. But nevertheless, they still hold the throne.<\/p>\n<p>King Joffrey Baratheon's reign is running now. As a wise man, he honors the history of his family. So, he commanded to build up <b>two<\/b> monuments, that will remind about some historical periods of the Baratheons.<\/p>\n<p>Formally, the Baratheons have been ruling for <b>N<\/b> years. Every year is described by an integer <b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, the level of prosperity in <b>i<\/b>-th year. If <b>i<\/b>-th year was a great year, then <b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> might be a positive integer. Otherwise, if <b>i<\/b>-th year was a horrible year, then <b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> might be a negative integer.<\/p>\n<p>Each historical period can be described as two integers <b>S<\/b> and <b>F<\/b>, the start and the finish of the period respectively. Of course, <b>S<\/b> is not greater than <b>F<\/b> for each period, that we consider in this task.<\/p>\n<p>You are to pick two historical periods, but there are some rules:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two periods shouldn't have common years. I.e. a period [1, 5] has no common years with a period [6, 7];<\/li>\n<li>The first period should start earlier than the second one. I.e. a period [1, 5] starts earlier than [6, 7];<\/li>\n<li>Two periods shouldn't be too close to each other. There must be at least <b>K<\/b> years between the finish of the first period and the start of the second period. I.e. periods [1, 5] and [10, 10] can be chosen in case <b>K<\/b> equals to 4, while they can't in case <b>K<\/b> equals to 5.<\/li>\n<li>The sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years should be as big as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Afterwards, you should report the sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years to your King. Make everything right, otherwise King Joffrey won't be merciful!<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
