### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/DIFSTR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/DIFSTR.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/DIFSTR.pdf) as well.

You are given $N$ binary strings of length $N$ each. You need to find a binary string of length $N$ which is different from all of the given strings.

Note:

- A binary string is defined as a string consisting only of `'0'` and `'1'`.
- A string is considered different from another string when they have different lengths, or when they differ in at least one position.
