<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>For given two positive integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> let's construct the sequence <b>x[1], x[2], ...</b> by the following rules. For <b>k=1</b> we put <b>x[1]=1</b>. Now let <b>k &gt;= 2</b>. Then <b>x[k]</b> is the least positive integer such that the following two conditions hold</p>
<ul>
<li><b>x[k] &gt; x[k - 1]</b>; </li>
<li> for all <b>i, j &lt; k</b> we have <b>x[k]</b> is not equal to <b>a * x[i] - b * x[j]</b>. </li>
</ul>
<p><br /> You need to find the first <b>n</b> terms of this sequence. <br /><br /> <b>Remark.</b> Let <b>a=2</b> and <b>b=1</b>. Then we see that sequence <b>x[1], x[2], ...</b> does not contain any arithmetic progression of length three as its subsequence. This justifies the problem title.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three integers <b>a, b</b> and <b>n</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the numbers <b>x[1], x[2], ..., x[n]</b> generated by the rules given in the problem statement and numbers <b>a, b</b>. Separate any two consecutive numbers in a line by a single space.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><b> 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50 <br /> 1 &lt;= a, b &lt;= 50 <br /> 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000 </b></p>
<h3>Example</h3>
