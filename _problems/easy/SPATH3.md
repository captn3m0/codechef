You are in a grid of dimensions $N \times M$.

You are allowed to perform two types of operations:
- Go down, left, up, or right each for a cost of $X$. Formally, if you are at the cell $(i,j)$ of the grid, you can go to either of the cells $(i + 1, j)$, $(i, j - 1)$, $(i - 1, j)$ or $(i, j + 1)$ at a cost of $X$.
- Go diagonally down-left, down-right, up-left, up-right, for a cost of $Y$. Formally, if you are at the cell $(i,j)$ of the grid, you can go to either of the cells $(i + 1, j - 1)$, $(i + 1, j + 1)$, $(i - 1, j - 1)$ or $(i - 1, j + 1)$ at a cost of $Y$.

You cannot exit the grid at any point. Find the minimum cost of going to the bottom-right corner $(N, M)$ from the top-left corner $(1, 1)$. 

$\textbf{Note}:$ Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
