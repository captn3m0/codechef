Chef found $N$ magical cards in his drawer. Each card has a number written on each of its faces. He places all the cards on the table in a front face-up manner.

Chef denotes the numbers on the front face by $A_1, A_2,..., A_N$ and on the back face by $B_1, B_2,..., B_N$. Chef can choose some (possibly zero or all) cards and flip them, then he will calculate the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the numbers currently in a face-up manner.

Now Chef wonders what is the *maximum* bitwise AND that he can achieve and what is the *minimum* number of cards he has to flip to achieve this value. Can you help him find it?
