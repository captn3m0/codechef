{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"BALLCOL","problem_name":"Colliding Balls","body":"There are $n$ red balls kept on the positive $X$ axis, and $m$ blue balls kept on the positive $Y$ axis. You are given the positions of the balls. For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the $i$-th red ball has the coordinates $(x_i, 0)$, where $x_i$ is a positive integer. For each $i$ from $1$ to $m$, the $i$-th blue ball has the coordinates $(0, y_i)$, where $ y_i$ is a positive integer. \r\n\r\nIt is given that all $x_i$ are distinct. Also, all $y_i$ are distinct.\r\n\r\nAt the time $t= 0$, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the $i^{\\text{th}}$ red ball is thrown towards positive $Y$ axis with a speed of $u_i$( that is, with velocity vector $(0, u_i)$). Simultaneously (at time $t = 0$), for each $i$ from $1$ to $m$, the $i^{\\text{th}}$ blue ball is thrown towards positive $X$ axis with a speed of $v_i$ (that is, with velocity vector $(v_i, 0)$).\r\n\r\nTwo balls are said to collide if they are at the same position at the same time.
