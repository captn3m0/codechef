You are given an integer $D$. You have to find a string $S$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:
- $S$ is non-empty and its length does not exceed $7 \cdot D$.
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters.
- The number of distinct substrings in $S$ minus the number of palindromic substrings in $S$ equals $D$. Here, when counting palindromic substrings, a substring that occurs multiple times should be counted multiple times.

It can be proved that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

Notes:
- A string $B$ is a substring of a string $A$ if $B$ can be obtained from $A$ by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.
- A palindrome is a string that does not change when it is reversed. E.g. strings "z", "aba" and "dammitimmad" are palindromes, but strings "ab" and "bojack" are not. 
- A palindromic substring is a substring which is also a palindrome.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $D$.

### Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer â€• the length of your string $S$. The second line should contain this string $S$.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le D \le 10^4$
- the sum of $D$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Example Input
```
4
4
10
15
60
```

### Example Output
```
4
todd
5
diane
6
bojack
12
peanutbutter
```

### Exaplanation
**Example case $1$:** There are $9$ distinct substrings in $S$: "t", "o", "d", "to", "od", "dd", "tod", "odd", "todd". Five of them are palindromic: "t", "o", "d", "d", "dd". Therefore, $D = 9 - 5 = 4$.

Notice that while counting palindromic substrings (but not while counting distinct substrings), we are including both occurrences of the substring "d".
