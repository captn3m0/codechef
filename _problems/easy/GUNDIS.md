The fight between Sardar Khan and Sultan to control Wasseypur is getting very intense. Sultan has asked Ramadhir to supply him with automatic guns and Wasseypur is about to become a war zone. But Sultan's sister Shama has revealed her brother's plans to her husband, Danish. The Sardar family must also buy automatic guns or risk annihilation.


The gun merchant they are buying guns from is very peculiar. He only sells guns to a person if the either sold the last gun to the same person or if the person is buying the gun for the first time. So if, Danish and Faizal go to buy guns, and Faizal buys the first gun after which Danish buys another, then Faial can no longer buy any gun as the last gun was not sold to him and he has already bought a gun. Meanwhile, Danish can buy as many more guns as he wants.


The merchant has $N$ guns in stock and each gun has a type $A_i$. He will only sell them in a particular order, he will also not sell more than a $1000$ guns to any one person. 


Sardar Khan wants his lackeys to visit the gun merchant and buy all the guns. Every lackey wants as many different types of guns as possible, for the intimidation power of a lackey is the number of unique guns they have. While the total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets from his lackeys is the product of their individual intimidation power.


Sardar needs to wins the fight against Sultan and asks his lackeys to buy the guns optimally, to maximise Sardar's intimidation power.


Find out the maximum intimidation power Sardar Khan can get.
