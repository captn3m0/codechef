### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/mandarin/BEAUSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/russian/BEAUSUB.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/vietnamese/BEAUSUB.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/bengali/BEAUSUB.pdf) as well. 

An array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers is called *$K$-beautiful* if it holds the following property:
The number of adjacent indices with different values is at most $K$. More formally, there are at most $K$ indices $i$ ($1\le i\lt N$) such that $A_i\ne A_{i+1}$. Note that according to this definition, if an array $A$ is $K$-beautiful, then $A$ is also $(K+1)$-beautiful.

You are given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers and an integer $K$. Find the length of the longest $K$-beautiful subsequence of $A$, where a subsequence is defined below.

For example, consider the array $A = [1 , 1, 2, 3, 2 , 4]$. The subsequences $[1, 1]$ and $[1, 1, 2]$ are $1$-beautiful, and the subsequences $[1, 2, 3]$ and $[1, 2, 2, 4]$ are $2$-beautiful.

**Note:**
- A sequence $a$ is a *subsequence* of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, $[3,1]$ is a subsequence of $[3,2,1]$ and $[4,3,1]$, but not a subsequence of $[1,3,3,7]$ and $[3,10,4]$.
