Then follow <b>R<\/b> lines, each containing <b>C<\/b> space separated integers - the costs of different gifts.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p> Print a single integer - a value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but highest in its column. If no such value exists, then print \"GUESS\" (without quotes of course) <\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p> 1 &lt;= <b>R<\/b>, <b>C<\/b> &lt;= 100 <\/p>\n<p> All gift costs are positive and less than 100000000 (10^8) <\/p>\n<h3>Example 1<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2 3\n9 8 8\n2 6 11\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n8\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Example 2<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3 3\n9 8 11\n2 6 34\n5 9 11\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nGUESS\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Example 3<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2 2\n10 10\n10 10\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n10\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation of Sample Cases<\/h3>\n<p><b>Example 1<\/b>: The first row contains 9, 8, 8.
