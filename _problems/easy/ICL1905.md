<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>There are $N$ planets numbered $1$ to $N$.  You are a space merchant who earns by selling goods on these planets. Traveling to each planet requires you to pay for the fuel. The difficulty of traveling to $i$-th planet is $D_i$. You need to plan your trip by choosing a consecutive sub segment of planets.

Your earning of the trip is calculated as follows -    
- You earn $A$ coins for every planet you visit.
- For each planet $i$ you visit, you have to pay $C_i$ coins for the fuel.
- If you visit every planet with indices $L$ to $R$, you also have to pay $gap(L,R)$ coins where    
$gap(L,R) = max [ (D_r - D_l)^2]$     $for L<=l<=r<=R$

Calculate the maximum profit you can earn by traveling to a consecutive segment of planets. Note that if you travel to no planet at all, your net profit will be zero.

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- For each testcase, the first line contains two integers $N$ and $A$
- The next $N$ lines contains two integers $C_i, D_i$

###Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.

###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 3000$
- $1 \leq A \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq D_i, C_i \leq 10^6$

###Sample Input:  
    1
    3 10
    1 3
    3 1
    2 2

###Sample Output:
    20
    
###EXPLANATION:
For L = 1 and R = 3, we have profit = (3 - 1 + 1) * 10 - (1 + 3 + 2) - (3 - 1)*(3 - 1) = 20. This is the maximum possible profit for any sub-segment.
