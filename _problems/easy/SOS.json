This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4 $\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$\n- The sum of $N$ for each test case is at most $2\\cdot 10^5$\n- $|C|=N$\n- $C$ consists of three types of characters, `'R'`, `'G'` and `'B'`\n- $1 \\leq u, v \\leq N, u \\neq v$\n- The input graph forms a tree","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Roughly speaking, this problem asks you to create the checker of [*the problem used in December CookOff*](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/problems\/RGBCONST).\n\nYou are given a tree with $N$ vertices and a string $C$ of length $N$, consisting of the characters `'R'`, `'G'` and `'B'`.\n\nFor each integer $i\\ (1\\leq i\\leq N)$, $C_i$ is the color of vertex $i$ \u2014 `'R'` is for Red, `'G'` is for Green and `'B'` is for Blue.\n\nThe input is called **valid** if for all pairs of Blue vertices $(u,\\ v),\\ u\\neq v$, there is at least one Red vertex and one Green vertex on the [simple path](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simple_path) between $u$ and $v$.\n\nYour task is to validate the input for given $T$ test cases.
