<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>Dustin, is the head of an Intelligence agency. He wants to send a secret message $S$ to his colleague.The message is a single word consisting of only lowercase english letters but he decides to encrypt the message for security reasons. He makes a string $M$ of length $N$, such that after deleting a substring of non-zero length from $M$, the remaining string is $S$.

Calculate the number of all such possible strings he can form.

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- For each testcase the there is a single line which contains an integer, $N$ and then a string $S$.

###Output:
For each testcase, output the number of possible strings modulo $10^9+7$.

###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 50$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$
- $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- $S$ can contain only lowercase English letters.

###Sample Input:
2    
3 a    
3 ab     

###Sample Output:
1326    
76
