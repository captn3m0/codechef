### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/hindi/KDIAMS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/mandarin/KDIAMS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/russian/KDIAMS.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/vietnamese/KDIAMS.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/bengali/KDIAMS.pdf) as well.

You are given integers $N$ and $K$. Construct a connected undirected unweighted graph with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$) such that there are exactly $K$ unordered pairs of nodes which have distance equal to the diameter of the graph (the largest distance between two nodes), or determine that no such graph exists.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If no valid graph exists, print a single line containing the integer $-1$.
- Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer $M$ â€” the number of edges in your graph.
- Then, print $M$ lines. Each of these lines must contain two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le N$; $u \neq v$) denoting the endpoints of one edge. All edges must be different, i.e. parallel edges are not allowed.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le K \le \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$

### Example Input
```
1
6 4
```

### Example Output
```
7
1 2
2 3
3 1
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 4
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The diameter of the graph is $3$. There are exactly $4$ unordered pairs of nodes at distance $3$: $(1, 5)$, $(1, 6)$, $(2, 5)$ and $(2, 6)$.
