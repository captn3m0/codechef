Sheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer $N$. To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert $N$ into an integer $M$ that can be represented in the form $2^x + 2^y$ (where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers such that $x \neq y$). In order to do that, he can perform two types of operations:
- add $1$ to $N$
- subtract $1$ from $N$

However, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert $N$ into a valid integer $M$?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of operations.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le T \le 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
10
22
4
```

### Example Output
```
0
2
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** $N=10$ is already in the form $2^x + 2^y$, with $x=3$ and $y=1$.

**Example case 2:** $N=22$ can be converted into $M=20=2^2+2^4$ or $M=24=2^3+2^4$ in two operations.

**Example case 3:** $N=4$ can be converted into $M=3=2^0+2^1$ or $M=5=2^0+2^2$ in one operation.
