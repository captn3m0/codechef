A tuple $(a, b, c)$ is considered good if it consists of three **prime numbers** $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that $a \lt b \lt c \leq N$ and $a + b = c$.

Two tuples are considered different if they differ in at least one position. Given $N$, find the number of good tuples that can be formed by integers from $1$ to $N$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The following $T$ lines contain a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of good tuples which can be formed using integers from $1$ to $N$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$

### Example Input
```
2
3
6
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are no good tuples. $(1, 2, 3)$ is not a good tuple since $1$ is not prime.

**Example case 2:** $(2, 3, 5)$ is a good tuple since $2$, $3$ and $5$ are prime and $2 + 3 = 5$.
