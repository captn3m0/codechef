Chef was working on building rail tracks connecting pairs of railway stations in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. There are $N$ stations on the $x$-axis, with coordinates $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$, and $M$ stations on the $y$-axis, with coordinates $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_M$. Chef has completed his task and built a rail track (line segment) between each pair of stations.

Now, Chef is wondering how many right triangles have the following property: the vertices are stations and the sides are railway tracks between them. Since Chef is busy with his other projects, help him answer this question.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$.
- The third line contains $M$ space-separated integers $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_M$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of right triangles.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $1 \le N, M \le 10^5$
- $|x_i| \le 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- $|y_i| \le 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- the positions of the stations are pairwise distinct

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):**
- $N, M \le 10^2$

**Subtask #2 (25 points):**
- $N, M \le 10^3$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2 2
-4 2
2 -8
8 4
1 2 3 6 -1 -2 -3 -6
6 -6 1 -1
```

### Example Output
```
1
8
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are no triplets where two stations lie on the $x$-axis and one triplet where two stations lie on the $y$-axis, which is $((0, 2), (0, -8), (-4, 0))$.
