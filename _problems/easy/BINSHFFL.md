<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><h3>Read problems statements in <a href="http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE18/mandarin/BINSHFFL.pdf" target="_blank">Mandarin chinese</a>, <a href="http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE18/russian/BINSHFFL.pdf" target="_blank">Russian</a> and <a href="http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JUNE18/vietnamese/BINSHFFL.pdf" target="_blank">Vietnamese</a> as well.</h3>

Chef has two integers $A$ and $B$. He can perform the following operation on $A$ an arbitrary number of times (including zero):
- write $A$ as a binary number with an arbitrary number of leading zeroes (possibly without any)
- shuffle the binary digits of $A$ in an arbitrary way, obtaining a number $s$
- replace $A$ by $s+1$

Chef is wondering about the minimum number of operations he has to perform on $A$ in order to obtain $B$. Compute this number or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of operations or $-1$ if it is impossible to obtain $B$ from $A$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $0 \le A, B \le 10^{18}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $A, B \le 2^7$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

### Example Output
```
2
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** One optimal solution is to not shuffle anything, so Chef just adds $1$ twice. 

**Example case 2:** We can obtain $5$ from $1$ in one operation.
