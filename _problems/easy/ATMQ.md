There are $N$ people waiting in a queue at ATM. The $i^{th}$ person in the queue has a power level equal to $A_i$ ($1 \leq A_i \leq N$). The following process happens every second till the queue is not empty.


- The person in front of the queue uses the ATM and then leaves the queue.
- After the first step, if the queue is empty, the process stops. Otherwise, for each person from left to right (except for the first person in the queue), if the person has a $\textbf{strictly greater}$ power level than the person in front of him, he will overtake the person in front, i.e. their positions get swapped. Note that the overtaking happens one after the other from left to right, i.e. state of the queue changes after every overtake.

For each person, find the time at which they will use the ATM.

$\textbf{Note}:$ Please refer to the explanation section for a simulation of one such scenario.
