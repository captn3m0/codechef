### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT20/hindi/REPLESX.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT20/bengali/REPLESX.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT20/mandarin/REPLESX.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT20/russian/REPLESX.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT20/vietnamese/REPLESX.pdf) as well.

You are given an array of $N$ integers $ A_1, A_2,\dots,A_N$ and three more integers $X, p,$ and $k$.

 An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the $k$-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.

Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly $0$ operations) to make the $p$-th smallest  element of the array equal to $X$. If it is impossible to do so output $-1$.

Note: the $k$-th smallest number in an array is the $k$-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains four integers $N, X, p, k$ respectively.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of operations you must perform to make $X$ the $p$-th smallest element or $-1$ if its impossible to do so.

### Constraints

- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1\leq p,k\leq N$
- $0\leq X \leq 10^9$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $4*10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $N \le 5$

**Subtask #2 (40 points):** The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3*10^3$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** Original constraints

### Example Input

```
2
5 4 3 4
4 9 7 0 8
2 25 1 2
100 20
```

### Example Output

```
1
-1
```

### Explanation

**Example case 1:**

- We can perform one operation in the array. Take the $k$-th smallest integer of the current array (which is $8$ in this case) and replace it with $0$. The array then becomes $[4,9,7,0,0]$ which now makes $4$ as the 3rd smallest number of the array.

**Example case 2:**

- It is impossible to make $25$ as the smallest number of the array.
