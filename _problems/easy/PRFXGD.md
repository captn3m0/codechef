Chef got a string $S$ with length $N$ as his birthday gift. A prefix of this string is *good* if each character occurs in it at most $X$ times.

Chef can delete at most $K$ characters from this string. He wants to maximise the number of good prefixes in the resulting string. Can you help him?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $S$.
- The second line contains two space-separated integers $K$ and $X$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of good prefixes.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N, X \le 10,000$
- $|S| = N$
- $0 \le K \le 10,000$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** $K = 0$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
abcdefagahai
0 1
abcdefagahai
1 1
abcdefagahai
2 1
```

### Example Output
```
6
7
8
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Chef cannot delete any characters and each character may occur only once in a good prefix, so there are only six good prefixes.
