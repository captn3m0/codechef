### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/XORSPRT.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/XORSPRT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/XORSPRT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/XORSPRT.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Find the number of ways to split it into one or more non-empty contiguous subsequences $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_k$ such that the following condition is satisfied: for each $i$ ($1 \le i \le k$), the XOR of all elements in $B_i$ is divisible by $2^{i-1}$.  

Since this number can be enormous, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).
