You have been given a string $S$ of size $N$ which consists of **uppercase characters** only. A  $K$-Magical String is a string in which the longest **non - decreasing subsequence** is of size exactly $K$.

You have been given $Q$ queries where each query is in the form $L, R,$ and $K$.
For each query, check whether substring from index $L$ to index $R$ can be converted into a $K$-Magical String or not by rearranging its characters and print the final rearranged string too. 

If there exist multiple answers, print the **lexicographically largest** string possible.
  
**Note:** 
- Each query will be treated independently i.e. after each query the string will remain the same as it was initially. 
- The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.
