He can't choose less than <b>K</b> since it will be not enough to complete the order in time. On the other hand if he chooses more than <b>K</b> subordinates he can't control them during the operation. Help him to find the number of ways he can choose the team to complete this very important order.

<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p> The first line contains a single positive integer <b>T &lt;= 100</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>, where <b>0 &lt;= N, K &lt; 2^64</b>. It is guaranteed that the answer will be less than <b>2^64</b>.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p> For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to choose the required team.
