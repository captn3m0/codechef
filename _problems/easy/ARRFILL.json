Initially, the array is filled with $0$-s.\n\nThere are $M$ types of operations that you can perform on array $A$. The $i^{th}$ operation can be described by two integers $(x_i, y_i)$. In this operation, you choose a set of indices $S$ such that \n\n- $1 \\leq j \\leq N$,\n- $(j \\bmod y_i) \\neq 0$,\n- $A_j = 0$, \n\n, then you set $A_j = x_i$ for all $j \\in S$.\n\n\nYou can perform the operations in any order, but one type of operation can't be done more than once. What is the maximum sum of integers of the array $A$ you obtain if you perform the $M$ operations optimally?\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the array $A = [0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n- Suppose $x = 3, y = 2$. Here you can choose indices $1$ and $3$ and set $A_1 = A_3 = 3$. So the array A becomes $[3, 0, 3, 0]$. In this operation you can't choose the indices $2$ and $4$ because $(2 \\bmod 2) = 0$, $(4 \\bmod 2) = 0$. \n- Suppose $x = 5, y = 3$ and you set $A_2 = 5$. So the array $A$ becomes $[3, 5, 3, 0]$. Here you can't choose index $1$ because $A_1 \\gt 0$ and index $3$ because $(3 \\bmod 3) = 0$ and $A_3 \\gt 0$. However, you could also set $A_4 = 5$.\n\n- Suppose $x = 4, y = 4$. Now you can't choose any index because $A_j \\gt 0$  for all $1 \\leq j \\leq 3$ and $(4 \\bmod 4) = 0$.
