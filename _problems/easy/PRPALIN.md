 An integer is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse. For example, 79197 and 324423 are palindromes. In this task you will be given an integer N, 1 N 1000000. You must find the smallest integer M N such that M is a prime number and M is a palindrome.

For example, if N is 31 then the answer is 101.

### Input

A single integer N, (1 N 1000000), on a single line.

### Output

Your output must consist of a single integer, the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

### Example

```
