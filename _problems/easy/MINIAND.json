One day Agnes asked Gru to answer some of her queries. She lined up $N$ minions in a straight line from $1$ to $N$. \r\n\r\nYou are given an array $A$ which contains the height of minions. Agnes will ask him several queries. In each query, Gru has to tell whether the bitwise AND of  $A[L \\ldots R]$ is EVEN or ODD. Since Gru is busy planning the biggest heist on Earth, he asks for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n- First line of the input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.\r\nFor each test case:-\r\n- First line contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of elements.\r\n- Second line contains $N$ spaced integer representing array elements.\r\n- Third line contains $Q$ representing number of query.\r\n- Next $Q$ lines contains two integer $L$ and $R$ as defined above.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\nFor each query, output \"EVEN\" or \"ODD\" without quotes.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\r\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n    1\r\n    5\r\n    1 3 2 4 5\r\n    3\r\n    1 2 \r\n    1 5\r\n    3 4\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n    ODD\r\n    EVEN\r\n    EVEN\r\n         \r\n###Explanation\r\n\r\n- For the first query, the bitwise AND of 1 and 3 is 1, which is Odd. Hence the first output is ODD.\r\n- For the third query, the bitwise AND of 2 and 4 is 0, which is Even. Hence the third output is EVEN.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"We all know Gru loves Agnes very much.
