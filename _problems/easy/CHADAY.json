Initially, the skill level of each player is zero. There are also $M$ challenges (numbered $1$ through $M$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th challenge has three parameters $L_i$, $R_i$ and $X_i$ with the following meaning: for each player between the $L_i$-th and $R_i$-th inclusive, if this player participates in this challenge, their skill level increases by $X_i$ ($X_i$ does not have to be positive).\r\n\r\nThe organizers of the Cooking Challenge decided that the contest would be boring if they let the participants participate in the challenges directly, so they decided to use the *compos*.\r\n\r\nThere are $Q$ compos (numbered $1$ through $Q$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th compo has two parameters $A_i$ and $B_i$, which means that it includes the challenges $A_i, A_i+1, \\ldots, B_i$.\r\n\r\nEach participant has to select a subset of the compos (possibly empty or the set of all $Q$ compos) and participate in all challenges those compos include. A participant may not select the same compo twice, but may participate in the same challenge more than once if it is included in multiple chosen compos.\r\n\r\nFor each player, find the maximum skill level this player can reach if the compos are chosen optimally.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $Q$.\r\n- $M$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $L_i$, $R_i$ and $X_i$.\r\n- $Q$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $A_i$ and $B_i$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers.
