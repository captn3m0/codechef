All submissions for this problem are available.Professor Sahil is a master artist, he always finds creative ways to teach lessons to his students. Today in Painting class he took all the students of the class to a wall. Professor Sahil asked every student to paint the wall upto a certain integral height one by one (second boy starts once the first boy finishes painting) from the bottom with any color of their wish, except a student Mudit who was made to stand behind the wall and note down all the data i.e the height upto which each student painted and the color $Ci$ every student used. At the end of the painting session Professor asked Mudit to tell how many distinct colors are there on the wall. Mudit being a weak student asked you for help. Formally, given a wall of infinite height, initially unpainted. There occur $N$ operations, and in ith operation, the wall is painted upto height $Hi$ with color $Ci$. Suppose in jth operation (j&gt;i) wall is painted upto height $Hj$ with color $Cj$ such that $Hj$ &gt;= $Hi$, the $Cith$ color on the wall is hidden. At the end of $N$ operations, you have to find the number of distinct colors(&gt;=1) visible on the wall. Help him find out the number of distinct colors on the wall. ###Input: - The first line consists of single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. - The second line contains 2 space separated integers $N$ and $M$, denoting the number of students and number of colors available (1 to $M$). - The third line contains $N$-space separated integers ($Hi$ ) denoting the height upto which each student painted the wall. - The fourth line contains $N$ space separated integers denoting the color ( $Ci$ ) the ith student used. ###Output: Print the number for distinct colors on the wall for each test case. ###Constraints - $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$ - $1 \\leq N ,M \\leq 10^5$ - \*\*Sum of N over all test cases
