It's not always easy to make up stories around problems â€• like this one.

We know that there is a hidden sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ which contains only integers between $1$ and $K$ inclusive. We have acquired $M$ triplets $(X_1, Y_1, Z_1), (X_2, Y_2, Z_2), \ldots, (X_M, Y_M, Z_M)$. A very reliable source has given us intel that for each valid $i$, the $Y_i$-th occurrence of the integer $X_i$ in the sequence $A$ is $A_{Z_i}$, i.e. $A_{Z_i} = X_i$ and there are $Y_i-1$ indices $j \lt Z_i$ such that $A_j = X_i$.

Find any sequence $A$ consistent with this information or determine that no such sequence exists.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $K$ and $M$.
- $M$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le M$), the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $X_i, Y_i$ and $Z_i$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If no valid sequence exists, print a single line containing the string `"No"`.
- Otherwise, print two lines.
- The first of these lines should contain the string `"Yes"`.
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le N, K, M \le 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le X_i \le K$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le Y_i, Z_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- all triplets are pairwise distinct
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $K$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

### Example Input
```
3
3 3 2
1 1 2
2 2 3
3 1 1
1 1 1
3 1 1
1 1 2
```

### Example Output
```
Yes
2 1 2 
Yes
1 1 1 
No
```
