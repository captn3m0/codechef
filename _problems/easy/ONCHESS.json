you want to play a game, you can either create new game and wait for an opponent to join, or you can join already created game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each player has a number representing his rating, after each game the winner will take some rating points from the loser, unless the players agreed to make the game unrated before the start<\/p>\n\n<p>Whenever you create a game you have first to choose some parameters for this game:\n\n<ul>\n<li>minimum and maximum rating for the opponent that you would like to play with<\/li>\n<li>whether this game will be rated or not<\/li>\n<li>the total thinking time allowed for each player<\/li>\n<li>whether you would like to play with white, black or let the server choose a random color random<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p><p>\nafter choosing those parameters and creating the game you will wait for an opponent to join your game, after someone joins the game will start.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<p>if you would like to join a game you can see the list of already created games that are still waiting for an opponent and you can see the parameters for each game after that you can select one of them to join.\n\n<\/p> \n\n<p>\nChef is one of the developers of this website and today he thought that it's good idea to add new feature to it, the feature is that whenever a player creates a new game before asking the player to wait for an opponent the website will try to automatically find suitable opponent among those who already have created a game and still waiting for opponent, the website should choose the opponent such that all parameters specified by both players must be satisfied, if more than one suitable match exists then the player who just created a game will  be matched with the suitable player who created a game first, if there's no match at all then the website will ask the player to wait for an opponent. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nrules applied to check whether two players can be matched:\n\n<ul>\n<li>rating of each player is inside the range of rating that the other player selected<\/li>\n\n<li>both players selected the game to be rated, or both of them selected the game to be unrated<\/li>\n\n<li>total thinking time chosen by both players are equal<\/li>\n\n\n<li>both players chose random color, or one of them chose white while the other chose black<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNow, given a list of players who created a new game, in the same order of creating, for each player find out if this player should be matched with another player who is at that time waiting for an opponent , if there are more than one possible match, then choose the one who created a game first (thus has waited more), if there is no match then ask the player to wait.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nnote that once a player is matched with another one then both players can no longer be matched with other players. also in this problem no player will join a game manually, all of them will create new game.\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>First line of

player 1 or player 2, so he will play with player 1 because he created a game first<\/li>\n<li>player 4 can be with player 1 or player 2, but player 1 already entered a game with player 3 so he is unavailable now so player 4 will play with player  2<\/li>\n<li>player 5 has to wait because there are no other players<\/li>\n<li>player 6 has to wait because he can't play with player 5 because player 6 wants colored to be selected at random, while player 5 wants to take white<\/li>\n<li>player 7 will play with player 5<\/li>\n\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF,
