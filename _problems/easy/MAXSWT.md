### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/russian/MAXSWT.pdf) and [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/mandarin/MAXSWT.pdf).

Chef goes to a candy store that sells $N$ different candies. For each candy, we know its price and sweetness. Chef has $D$ dollars and can take a maximum of $2$ candies, one in each hand. Find the maximum total sweetness he can buy under the given constraints.

**NOTE:** Since the input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
