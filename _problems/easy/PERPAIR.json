This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\le K \\lt N \\leq 10^7$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (10 points):** $0 \\le K \\lt N \\leq 9$.\n\n- **Subtask 2 (30 points):** Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.\n\n- **Subtask 3 (60 points):** original constraints.","subtasksState":true,"statement":"For an integer $K$ and a permutation $A = [A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N]$ of values from $1$ to $N$, we define a function $f(A)$ that returns the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that\n- $1 \\le i \\lt j \\le N$\n- $j \\gt i+K$\n- $A_j \\gt A_i$\n- For all $x \\geq (i+1)$ and $x\\leq(j-1)$ , $A_x \\lt A_i$\n- for all $x \\lt i$ , $A_x \\lt A_i$\n\nIn simple words, in the subarray $A_{[1..j]}$, $A_i$ is the second-largest element and $A_j$ is the\nlargest element.\n\nYou are given $K$.
