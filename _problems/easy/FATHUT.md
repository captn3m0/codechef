### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/bengali/FATHUT.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/mandarin/FATHUT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/russian/FATHUT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/vietnamese/FATHUT.pdf) as well.

There are $N$ breakfasts in the restaurant `“Fat Hut”` where the Chef works. The $i^{th}$ breakfast has an attractiveness $A_i$ and cost $C_i$. 

The Chef has noticed that nobody takes the $j^{th}$ breakfast if there exists at least one breakfast $i$ such that $A_i \ge A_j$ and $C_i \lt C_j$. 

In other words, if a breakfast is less attractive and more expensive than any of the other dishes, then nobody is interested in that breakfast.

The Chef will be happy if all the $N$ breakfasts have a chance to be taken. Unfortunately, the Chef has no power over prices. On the other hand, he can change the attractiveness of some breakfasts by some real number. However, after the changes, the attractiveness of the $i^{th}$ breakfast must lie in the interval $[L_i,R_i]$.


He would also like to change the attractiveness of the minimum number of breakfasts. Help the Chef do it.
