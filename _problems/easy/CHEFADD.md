<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problems statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S191ATST/hindi/CHEFADD.pdf), [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S191ATST/mandarin/CHEFADD.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S191ATST/russian/CHEFADD.pdf), [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S191ATST/vietnamese/CHEFADD.pdf) and [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S191ATST/bengali/CHEFADD.pdf) as well.

Chef likes to solve difficult tasks. This time, he tried to solve the Big Famous Unsolvable $A+B=C$. One of his friends played a prank on Chef and randomly shuffled the bits in $A$ and $B$ (independently in each number). However, the funny thing is that the sum of the resulting numbers remained $C$ even after shuffling.

Chef is now wondering: in how many ways is it possible to shuffle the bits of $A$ and the bits of $B$ such that their sum after shuffling is equal to $C$? Let's denote the integers obtained by shuffling the bits of $A$ and $B$ by $A_s$ and $B_s$ respectively; two ways $(A_{s1}, B_{s1})$ and $(A_{s2}, B_{s2})$ are considered distinct if $A_{s1} \neq A_{s2}$ or $B_{s1} \neq B_{s2}$.

It is allowed to add any number (possibly zero) of leading zeroes, i.e. bits $0$, to $A$ and any number of leading zeroes to $B$ before shuffling the bits.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $A$, $B$ and $C$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of ways to shuffle the bits.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le A, B, C \le 10^9$
- $A+B = C$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** $1 \le A, B, C \le 10^5$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1 2 3
369 428 797
```

### Example Output
```
2
56
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We can consider $A=01$ and $B=10$ in binary. Then, there are two possible ways: swapping the two bits of $A$ and the two bits of $B$ ($A_s=10$, $B_s=01$ in binary, $2$ and $1$ in decimal representation) or not shuffling any bits.
