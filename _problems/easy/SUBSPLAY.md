Chef has always been fond of girls, but he could not make any girl his friend. In order to finally make one, he was asked to solve the following problem:

You are given a string $S$ with length $N$. Choose an integer $K$ and two non-empty subsequences $A$ and $B$ of characters of this string, each with length $K$, such that:
- $A = B$, i.e. for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character in $A$ is the same as the $i$-th character in $B$.
- Let's denote the indices of characters used to construct $A$ by $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_K$, i.e. $A = (S_{a_1}, S_{a_2}, \ldots, S_{a_K})$. Similarly, let's denote the indices of characters used to construct $B$ by $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_K$.
- If we denote the number of common indices in the sequences $a$ and $b$ by $M$, then $M+1 \le K$.

Since Chef is busy right now, he asks you to find the maximum value of $K$ such that it is possible to find sequences $A$ and $B$ which satisfy the given conditions or determine that there is no such $K$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum $K$, or $0$ if there is no solution.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $N \le 8$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
4
anxa
```

### Example Output
```
1
```
