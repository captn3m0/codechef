The resultant value will be $120\/8 = 15$ and $15\/15 = 1$. The number $1$ has exactly one divisor and hence output is $1$.        \r\nNote that, If we divided $N=120$ by $6$ then we won't get the optimal answer.       \r\n\r\n**Example case 5:** We can divide $N=45$ by $15$ and resultant value of $N$ will be $3$.
