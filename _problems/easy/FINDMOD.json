Your first query is $X=5$, so the jury returns $5 \\bmod 6 = 5$. Your second query is $X=6$, so the jury returns $6 \\bmod 6 = 0$. Finally, you output $6$ as the final answer, which is the correct answer.\n- **Test case $2$:** Jury's secret number is $N=39$. Your first query is $X=4$, so the jury returns $4 \\bmod 39 = 4$. Your second query is $X=5$, so the jury returns $5 \\bmod 39 = 5$.
