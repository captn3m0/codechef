### Read problems statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/russian/ADJHATE.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/bengali/ADJHATE.pdf).

An array is called *lovely* if the sum of absolute differences of each adjacent pair of elements is odd; formally, the array $S$ of size $m$ is lovely if $\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}$ $|S_i-S_{i+1}|$ is odd.

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers. You need to reorder the array in any manner such that the array becomes lovely. If there is no reordering operation that makes the array lovely, output `-1`.
