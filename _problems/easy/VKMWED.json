Before stepping into the fight, each of them smoked a special kind of weed from Jhalwa. Smoking $k$ grams of this weed can grant the smoker the ability to resurrect $k$ times after dying. Sultan smoked $M$ grams of this weed, and Faizal smoked $N$ grams of this weed. \n\n\nHowever, Faizal being an addict since childhood has developed a side effect, the abilities of this weed come with a condition for him(Faizal): if Faizal dies, he gains back his resurrection power only after he has killed Sultan at least once after having resurrected from his(Faizal's) last death i.e the weed will become temporarily disabled after the resurrection, to be reactivated Faizal needs to kill Sultan whereas Sultan can resurrect any time. \n\nFaizal's wife Mohsina is getting anxious about the fight, she wants you to find the possible number of ways the fight between Faizal and Sultan can go.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2000$\n- $0 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq M \\leq 10^5$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases will not exceed $10^6$\n- Sum of $M$ over all test cases will not exceed $10^6$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Faizal and Sultan are having a one-on-one faceoff. Before stepping into the fight, each of them smoked a special kind of weed from Jhalwa. Smoking $k$ grams of this weed grants the smoker the ability to resurrect $k$ times after dying. Sultan smoked $M$ grams of this weed, and Faizal smoked $N$ grams.\n\nHowever, Faizal was addicted to this kind of weed since his childhood, and so developed a side effect: if Faizal dies and is resurrected, he temporarily loses his ability to resurrect; and only gains it back after killing Sultan at least once (given that he hasn't resurrected $N$ times already). Sultan has no such restriction.\n\nThe fight ends whenever one of the two is killed without being able to resurrect. In other words, either Sultan is killed $M+1$ times, or Faizal is killed $N+1$ times, or Faizal is killed twice in a row.\n\nAny possible fight can be described by the sequence of deaths - for example, with $N = 2$ and $M = 2$, the string $FSSFS$ encodes the fight where:\n1. First, Sultan kills Faizal. Faizal resurrects, and temporarily loses his ability to resurrect.\n2. Then, Faizal kills Sultan. Sultan resurrects, and Faizal's resurrection is now active.\n3. Faizal kills Sultan again. Sultan resurrects.\n4. Sultan kills Faizal, who resurrects. Now Sultan has no more chances to revive.\n5. Faizal kills Sultan, who stays dead; and the fight ends.\n\nFaizal's wife Mohsina is getting anxious about the fight and asks for your help in finding the number of different ways the fight between Faizal and Sultan can end up happening. Because this value can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nTwo fights are considered different if and only if the sequence of deaths corresponding to those fights are different. For example, the sequence $SF$ is different from the sequence $FS$ and hence these represent different fights.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
