### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/mandarin/MINLCM1.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/russian/MINLCM1.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/vietnamese/MINLCM1.pdf) as well.

You are given two positive integers $X$ and $K$.

You have to output the minimum and maximum value of $LCM(i, j)$ where $X \leq i \lt j \leq X \cdot K$. 

We define $LCM(i, j)$ for two positive integers $i$ and $j$ as the minimum positive integer $y$ such that both $i$ and $j$ divide $y$ without remainder.
