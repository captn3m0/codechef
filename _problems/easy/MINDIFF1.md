### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKQL21/mandarin/MINDIFF1.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKQL21/russian/MINDIFF1.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCKQL21/vietnamese/MINDIFF1.pdf) as well.

You're given a simple undirected graph $G$ with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges. You have to assign, to each vertex $i$, a number $C_i$ such that $1 \leq C_i \leq N$ and $\forall i \neq j, C_i \neq C_j$.

For any such assignment, we define $D_i$ to be the number of neighbours $j$ of $i$ such that $C_j < C_i$. 

You want to minimise ${max_{i \in \{1..N\}} D_i} - {min_{i \in \{1..N\}} D_i}$.

Output the minimum possible value of this expression for a valid assignment as described above, and also print the corresponding assignment.

**Note:** 
- The given graph need not be connected.
- If there are multiple possible assignments, output anyone. 
- Since the input is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
