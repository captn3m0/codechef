You are given two integers $N$ and $M$. You have to construct a matrix with $N$ rows and $M$ columns. Consider a multiset $S$ which contains $N + M$ integers: for each row and each column of this matrix, the MEX of the elements of this row/column belongs to $S$. Then, in the matrix you construct, the MEX of $S$ must be maximum possible. 

Note: The MEX of a multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in this multiset. For example, $\mathrm{MEX}(\{4,9,0,1,1,5\}) = 2$ and $\mathrm{MEX}(\{1,2,3\}) = 0$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.

### Output
For each test case, print $N$ lines. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines should contain $M$ space-separated integers â€• the elements in the $i$-th row of your matrix. Each element of the matrix must be non-negative and must not exceed $10^9$.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 400$
- $1 \le N, M \le 100$
- the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Example Input
```
2
3 3
4 2
```

### Example Output
```
9 1 0
1 0 2
7 5 8
2 2
3 0
1 1
0 1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The MEXs of the rows $\{9, 1, 0\}$, $\{1, 0, 2\}$ and $\{7, 5, 8\}$ are $2$, $3$ and $0$ respectively. The MEXs of the columns $\{9, 1, 7\}$, $\{1, 0, 5\}$ and $\{0, 2, 8\}$ are $0$, $2$ and $1$ respectively. Therefore, the multiset which contains the MEX of each row and each column is $S = \{0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3\}$ and $\mathrm{MEX}(S) = 4$. We can show that this is the largest MEX that can be obtained for a $3 \times 3$ matrix.
