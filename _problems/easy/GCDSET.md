Misha calls a non-empty set of positive integers *nice* if it has the following properties:
- Each element of the set is between $l$ and $r$ (inclusive).
- The greatest positive integer which divides each element of the set is exactly $g$.

Misha likes nice sets, so she wants to find the size of the largest nice set. Help her solve the problem.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $l$, $r$ and $g$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum number of elements in a nice set, or $0$ if no nice set exists.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 200$
- $1 \le g \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$

### Example Input
```
2
5 15 4
15 20 35
```

### Example Output
```
2
0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Misha can choose the set $\{8, 12\}$.

**Example case 2:** All numbers in the range $[l, r]$ are smaller than $35$, so there is no way to choose a non-empty subset of these numbers where each element is divisible by $35$ and the answer is $0$.
