This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5000$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Given a positive integer $N$, find an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N]$ of length $N$ consisting of **distinct** integers from $1$ to $10^9$, such that the following condition is satisfied for each subarray $[A_L, A_{L+1}, \\ldots, A_r]$ ($1\\leq L \\leq R\\leq N$):\n\n- The sum of elements in the subarray is divisible by its length i.e. $A_L + A_{L+1} + \\ldots + A_R$ is divisible by $R - L + 1$.\n\nIt can be proved that such an array always exists under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple possible arrays, you may print **any** of them.","inputFormat":"- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
