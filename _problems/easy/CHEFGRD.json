This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $3 \\leq N \\lt 2 \\cdot 10^4$\n- $N$ is always odd.\n- $1 \\leq x_s, y_s \\leq N$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Akash is stuck in a $N \\times N$ grid, where $N$ is **odd**. The rows of the grid are numbered $1$ to $N$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered $1$ to $N$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the $i$-th row and $j$-th column will be denoted $(i, j)$.\n\nThe grid has a unique center cell \u2014 $((N+1)\/2, (N+1)\/2)$. For example, when $N = 5$ the center is cell $(3, 3)$.\n\nAkash is currently at cell $(x_s, y_s)$. He would like to reach the exit of the grid, which is located at the center. **It is guaranteed that $(x_s, y_s)$ is not the center.**\n\nSuppose Akash is at cell $(x, y)$. He can make the following movements:\n- He can freely move along diagonals, i.e, to cells $(x-1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x+1, y+1)$ \n- He can move one step horizontally or vertically with the cost of $1$ gold coin, i.e, to cells $(x, y-1), (x, y+1), (x-1, y), (x+1, y)$\n\nNote that Akash is not allowed to make a move that will take him out of bounds of the grid.\n\nAkash would like to minimize the number of coins required to reach the center.

Akash can go from $(3,1)$ to $(2,2)$ with a diagonal move, then from $(2,2)$ to $(3, 3)$ with another diagonal move.
