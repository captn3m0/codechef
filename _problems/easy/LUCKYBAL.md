All submissions for this problem are available.A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes _lucky strings_, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits **4** and **7**.

The Little Elephant calls some string **T** of the length **M** _balanced_ if there exists at least one integer **X** (**1 ≤ X ≤ M**) such that the number of digits **4** in the substring **T\[1, X - 1\]** is equal to the number of digits **7** in the substring **T\[X, M\]**. For example, the string **S = 7477447** is balanced since **S\[1, 4\] = 7477** has 1 digit **4** and **S\[5, 7\] = 447** has 1 digit **7**. On the other hand, one can verify that the string **S = 7** is not balanced.

 The Little Elephant has the string **S** of the length **N**. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers **(L; R)** that **1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N** and the substring **S\[L, R\]**  is balanced. Help him to find this number.

**Notes.**

Let **S** be some lucky string. Then - **|S|** denotes the length of the string **S**;
- **S\[i\]** (**1 ≤ i ≤ |S|**) denotes the **i**th character of **S** (the numeration of characters starts from **1**);
- **S\[L, R\]** (**1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ |S|**) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: **S\[L\], S\[L + 1\], ..., S\[R\]**, and is called a _substring_ of **S**. For **L > R** we mean by **S\[L, R\]** an empty string.

### Input

The first line of the input file contains a single integer **T**, the number of test cases. Each of the following **T** lines contains one string, the string **S** for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.

### Output

For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case. ### Constraints

 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 10

 1 ≤ **|S|** ≤ 100000

 **S** consists only of the lucky digits **4** and **7**.

### Example

```

<b>Input:</b>
4
47
74
477
4747477

<b>Output:</b>
2
2
3
23


```
### Explanation

In the first test case balance substrings are **S\[1, 1\] = 4** and **S\[1, 2\] = 47**.

In the second test case balance substrings are **S\[2, 2\] = 4** and **S\[1, 2\] = 74**.

**Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.**
