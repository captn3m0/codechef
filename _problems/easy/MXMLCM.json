To pass some time, he has started learning cryptography. He is very excited to see different types of keys used in cryptography and decided to invent a new type of a key.\r\n\r\nFirst, Chef made a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$, which lie between $1$ and $M$ inclusive. After a lot of sleepless nights, he has decided that his key will be the LCM of this sequence, but he is not satisfied \u2015 he wants to make his key as large as possible. In order to do that, he wants to append exactly one more integer to the sequence. This integer must also lie between $1$ and $M$ inclusive.\r\n\r\nHelp Chef maximise the key. Find the integer which Chef should append to the sequence in order to make the key (the LCM of elements of the resulting sequence) as large as possible. If there are multiple solutions, choose the smallest among the integers to append which maximise the LCM.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
