It can be proved that there is a unique such partition. We will be interested only with this partition in the problem.\r\n\r\nWe call $S_i$ the index of the subarray in which element $i$ lies. \r\n\r\nWe now want to support some operations on the array. In particular, there are $Q$ operations of the form - \r\n* $1$ $i$  $X$ - Change $A_i$ to $X$ \r\n* $2$  $i$ - Given $i$ , output the smallest $j$ such that $S_i = S_j$.
