For each valid $i$, the $i$-th point is $(x_i, y_i)$. He also has a fixed integer $c$ and he may perform operations of the following type: choose a point $(x_i, y_i)$ and move it to $(x_i + c, y_i + c)$ or $(x_i - c, y_i - c)$.\r\n\r\nNow, Chef wants to set up one or more *checkpoints* (points in the same coordinate system) and perform zero or more operations in such a way that after they are performed, each of his (moved) $N$ points is located at one of the checkpoints.\r\n\r\nChef's primary objective is to minimise the number of checkpoints.
