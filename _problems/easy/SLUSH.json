The machine produces slush drinks with $M$ flavors (numbered $1$ through $M$); for each valid $i$, the maximum number of drinks with flavour $i$ the machine can produce is $C_i$.\n\nChef expects $N$ customers to come buy slush drinks today. The customers are numbered $1$ through $N$ in the order in which they buy the drinks. For each valid $i$, the favorite flavour of the $i$-th customer is $D_i$ and this customer is willing to pay $F_i$ units of money for a drink with this flavour, or $B_i$ units of money for a drink with any other flavuor. Whenever a customer wants to buy a drink:\n- if it is possible to sell this customer a drink with their favourite flavour, Chef must sell them a drink with this flavour\n- otherwise, Chef must sell this customer a drink, but he may choose its flavour\n\nChef wants to make the maximum possible profit.
