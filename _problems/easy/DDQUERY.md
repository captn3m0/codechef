### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME77/hindi/DDQUERY.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME77/bengali/DDQUERY.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME77/mandarin/DDQUERY.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME77/russian/DDQUERY.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME77/vietnamese/DDQUERY.pdf) as well.

You are given an unweighted tree with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$). Let's denote the distance between any two nodes $p$ and $q$ by $d(p, q)$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given parameters $a$, $d_a$, $b$, $d_b$, and you should find a node $x$ such that $d(x, a) = d_a$ and $d(x, b) = d_b$, or determine that there is no such node.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that nodes $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains four space-separated integers $a$, $d_a$, $b$ and $d_b$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of a node satisfying the given requirements, or $-1$ if no such node exists.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^6$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- the graph on the input is a tree
- $1 \le a, b \le N$
- $1 \le d_a, d_b \lt N$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points)**:
- $1 \le N, Q \le 1,000$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,000$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,000$

**Subtask #2 (50 points)**: original constraints
