This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^{18}$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask $1$ (30 points):** $1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9$\n- **Subtask $2$ (10 points):** $A = 1$\n- **Subtask $3$ (60 points):** Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Egor came to the Olympiad in Informatics. But the tasks turned out to be too difficult, so Egor chose to sleep instead of solving problems. But as we all know, everyone is very happy when someone is the first who solved the problem. \n\nThere are $N$ problems in the contest. The $i$-th of them was solved at minute $L_i$ for the first time. This task will stop increasing the joy of everyone around at the minute $R_i + 1$ (that is, $R_i$ is the last minute when the task increases the joy). In other words, the $i$-th task increases the joyfulness for everyone by $1$ unit from the minute $L_i$ to the minute $R_i$.\n\nIn the anime that Egor watched recently, there are various techniques that can make a person fall asleep. Egor knows techniques that will allow him to sleep for any minutes between $A$ and $B$ minutes, i.e. Egor can sleep for $A$ minutes, $A + 1$ minutes, ..., $B$ minutes. Egor can also combine techniques, i.e. he can choose techniques with **different** duration and then sleep the total time of all techniques.\n\nEgor wants to combine techniques to wake up in the most joyful moment possible. Your task is to find the **maximum** joy in which Egor can wake up.","inputFormat":"- The first line of the input contains the number $T$ - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\n- The first line of each test case contains integers $N$, $A$, and $B$ - the number of tasks and $A, B$ values described in the statement.\n- The next $N$ lines give you a description of the problems.

At that time, there are $2$ tasks that give Egor joy: task $1$ (which gives joy during the range $[1, 5]$), and task $2$ (which gives joy during the range $[3, 9]$). It can be proven that Egor cannot acquire joy from all $3$ tasks at the same time, so $2$ is the maximum joyfulness Egor can wake up to.\n- **Test case $2$:** We can use techniques $15$, $22$, and $32$ to wake up at minute $15 + 22 + 32 = 69$. At that time. there are $2$ tasks that give Egor joy: task $1$ and task $3$.\n- **Test case $3$:** The maximum minute we can wake up to is $1 + 2 + \\dots + 9 = 45$, which means we cannot acquire joy from any task.","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/v7Dilv-uV8g","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"vaaven","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>vaaven<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"23-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/binary-search'>binary-search<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime103'>ltime103<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/vaaven'>vaaven<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Easy-Medium","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"Binary Search","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/SLEEPTECH","time":{"view_start_date":1640453400,"submit_start_date":1640453400,"visible_start_date":1640453400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797881},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=SLEEPTECH","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
