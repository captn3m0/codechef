You work as an engineer. You were given an empty board with $K$ consecutive cells; at any moment, each cell can display one character. You want the board to display a string $S$ with length $N &gt; K$. Since the board isn't large enough, you want to display the string in $N-K+1$ steps. In the $i$-th step ($1 \\le i \\le N-K+1$), you'll make the board display the characters $S\_i, S\_{i+1}, \\dots, S\_{i+K-1}$. The power required to switch the board from step $i$ to step $i+1$ (for $1 \\le i \\le N-K$) is equal to the number of characters displayed on the board that have to change between these steps. You should find the total power required for the whole process of displaying a string, i.e. the sum of powers required for switching between all consecutive pairs of steps. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the total power required for text switching. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$ - $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$ - $1 \\le K \\lt N$ - each character of $S$ is a lowercase English letter - the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (20 points):\*\* - $1 \\le T \\le 100$ - $2 \\le N \\le 50$ \*\*Subtask #2 (80 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 3 6 3 aabbcc 5 2 abccc 4 3 aabb ``` ### Example Output ``` 4 3 1 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* - In step $1$, the board is displaying "aab". - In step $2$, the board is displaying "abb". - In step $3$, the board is displaying "bbc". - In step $4$, the board is displaying "bcc". The power required for switching from the $1$-st to the $2$-nd step is $1$, because cell $1$ changes from 'a' to 'a' (requiring power $0$), cell $2$ changes from 'a' to 'b' (requiring power $1$) and cell $3$ changes from 'b' to 'b' (requiring power $0$); $0 + 1 + 0 = 1$. The power required for switching between the $2$-nd and $3$-rd step is $2$ and the power required for switching between the $3$-rd and $4$-th step is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.
