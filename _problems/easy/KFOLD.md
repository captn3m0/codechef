You are given a binary string $S$ with length $N$ and an integer $K$, which is a divisor of $N$. A string is said to be $K$*-foldable* if it can be changed to a string with length $K$ by repeating the following process without any *collisions* (defined below):
- Select the prefix of the current string $S$ with length $2K$. (Note that as long as the length of $S$ is greater than $K$, this prefix always exists.)
- For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le K$), check if the $2K-i+1$-th character of $S$ is equal to the $i$-th character of $S$ â€• if they are not equal, there is a collision and the process is invalid.
- Erase the prefix of $S$ with length $K$.

Your goal is to reorder the characters of $S$ (possibly leaving this string unchanged) in such a way that the resulting string $S$ is a $K$-foldable string. Find a way to do that or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest rearranged string which is $K$-foldable.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the smallest rearranged string or the string `"IMPOSSIBLE"` if it is impossible to rearrange $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^3$
- $N$ is divisible by $K$
- $S$ contains only characters '0' and '1'

### Example Input
```
2
8 2
00011101
6 2
100111
```

### Example Output
```
01100110
IMPOSSIBLE
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** If the given string "00011101" is rearranged to "01100110", it becomes $2$-foldable:
- Initially, $S$ is "01100110".
- After the first folding, it becomes "100110".
- After the second folding, it becomes "0110".
- After the third folding, it becomes "10". This string has length $2$, so we are done.

**Example case 2:** It is impossible to rearrange $S$ into a $2$-foldable string.
