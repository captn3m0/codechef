### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/bengali/DIGITREM.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/mandarin/DIGITREM.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/russian/DIGITREM.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/vietnamese/DIGITREM.pdf) as well.

You are given an integer $N$ and a digit $D$. Find the minimum non-negetive integer you should add to $N$ such that the final value of $N$ does not contain the digit $D$.
