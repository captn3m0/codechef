All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is studying Rotational Motion in physics. Here is preparing for Engineering Entrance exam. He's stuck in a problem. Which states that "Two fans, each with a single blade are rotating one above the other, about the same axis of rotation and both blades have the same length. Consider the blade as a rod. Both the fans are rotating indefinitely. 


Fans can rotate in either **clockwise** or **anticlockwise** direction. There is a dot marked on the blade of both the fans and the dot is marked at the same distance from the center of rotation.
You're be given speeds of the fans.

3. Clockwise rotation - positive speed.
4. Anticlockwise rotation - negative speed.


Help Chef to find the number of distinct points the dots will coincide on the circumference of rotation.

### Input

First line consists of **T** Test cases.
Each of the next **T** lines consists of Two numbers **S1** and **S2** which describes the speed of rotation of both the fans respectively

### Output

Print **T** lines with each containing the required answer.

### Constraints

11. 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100
12. **S1** ≠ **S2**
13. **S1,S2** ≠ 0
14. -100000 ≤ **S1,S2** ≤ 100000.
