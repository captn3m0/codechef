He also shows them his future using a string $S$ of length $L$ where $S_i = 0$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as bad as per the rule books of heaven and $S_i = 1$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as good.\r\n\r\nAlso, Strange can use his special powers to make Chef end his life earlier than that planned by god, i.e, he can choose some $L'$ ($1\\leq L'\\leq L$) and make him live for only $L' $ years.
