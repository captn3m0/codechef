{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"SUBMEDIA","problem_name":"Meet In The Median","body":"You're given a sequence of $N$ **distinct** integers. You need to find a subsequence of length $K$ with the maximum possible median.\n\nThe median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is selected. For example, if the sequence is $[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]$, then the median is $3$ since after sorting, it will look like $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $3$ is the only middle element. The median of $[4, 2, 1, 5]$ is $2$ since after sorting, the value $2$ is the left of the two middle elements $2$ and $4$.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if the sequence is $[2, 1, 4, 5, 7]$, then $[1, 5, 7]$, $[2, 1, 4]$, $[5]$ are some valid subsequences but $[4, 1, 2]$, $[1, 6, 7]$ are not.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 30$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $5 \\times 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You're given a sequence of $N$ **distinct** integers.
