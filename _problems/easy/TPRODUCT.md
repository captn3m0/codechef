<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Given a complete binary tree with the height of H, we index the nodes respectively top-down and left-right from 1. The i-th node stores a positive integer V<sub>i</sub>. Define P<sub>i</sub> as follows: P<sub>i</sub>=V<sub>i</sub> if the i-th node is a leaf, otherwise P<sub>i</sub>=max(V<sub>i</sub>*P<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>i</sub>*P<sub>R</sub>), where L and R are the indices of the left and right children of i, respectively. Your task is to caculate the value of P<sub>1</sub>.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:
<ul>
<li>The first line contains a positive integer H (H â‰¤ 15).</li>
<li>The second line contains 2<sup>H</sup>-1 positive integers (each having a value of 10<sup>9</sup> at most), the i-th integer shows the value of V<sub>i</sub>.</li>
</ul>
The input is ended with H = 0.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective value of P<sub>1</sub> found, by modulo of 1,000,000,007.
</p>
