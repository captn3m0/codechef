### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/hindi/FLIP.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/mandarin/FLIP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/russian/FLIP.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/vietnamese/FLIP.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK124/bengali/FLIP.pdf) as well.

You are given two binary strings $A$ and $B$ with the same length.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): pick a substring of $A$ with odd length and invert all the bits (change '0' to '1' or vice versa) at odd positions in this substring. For example, if we choose a substring "**0**1**0**1**1**", we can convert it to "**1**1**1**1**0**" (bits at odd positions are bold).

Determine the minimum number of operations required to change the string $A$ to the string $B$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $A$.
- The second line contains a single string $B$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10^3$
- $1 \le |A| = |B| \le 10^5$
- $A$ and $B$ contain only characters '0' and '1'
- the sum of $|A|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Example Input
```
3
100001
110111
1010
1010
000
111
```

### Example Output
```
2
0
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Initially, $A$ is "100001". We choose the substring "**0**0**0**" between the $2$-nd and $4$-th character and convert it to "**1**0**1**".

Now $A$ becomes "110101". We choose the string "**0**" containing only the $5$-th character and convert it to "**1**".

Finally, $A$ becomes "110111", which is equal to $B$.

**Example case 2:** $A$ and $B$ are initially equal, so there is no need to perform any operation.
