### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START9/mandarin/BUS.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START9/bengali/BUS.pdf).

There is an **empty bus** with $M$ seats and a total of $N$ people, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Everyone is currently outside the bus. You are given a sequence of $Q$ events of the following form.

 - $+\ i$ :  It denotes that the person $i$ enters the bus.

 - $-\ i$ : It denotes that the person $i$ leaves the bus.

It is guaranteed in the input that each person from $1$ to $N$ enters *at most* once as well as leaves the bus *at most* once.

Determine whether the sequence of events is *consistent* or not (i.e. no person leaves the bus before entering and the number of passengers in the bus does not exceed $M$ at any point of time).
