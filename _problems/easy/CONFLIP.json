After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named <b>COIN FLIP<\/b>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn this game the player will use <b>N<\/b> coins numbered from <b>1<\/b> to <b>N<\/b>, and all the coins will be facing in \"Same direction\" (Either <b>Head<\/b> or <b>Tail<\/b>),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe player needs to play <b>N<\/b> rounds.In the <b>k<\/b>-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to <b>k<\/b>. That is, the face of coin <b>i<\/b> will be reversed, from <b>Head<\/b> to <b>Tail<\/b>, or, from <b>Tail<\/b> to <b>Head<\/b>, for <b>i<\/b> \u2264 <b>k<\/b>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nElephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing <b>N<\/b> rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game <b>COIN FLIP<\/b>, so Elephant plays <b>G<\/b> times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.\n<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input contains an integer <b>T<\/b>, denoting the number of test cases.\nThen <b>T<\/b> test cases follow.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe first line of each test contains an integer <b>G<\/b>, denoting the number of games played by Elephant. Each of the following <b>G<\/b> lines denotes a single game, and contains 3 space separeted integers <b>I<\/b>, <b>N<\/b>, <b>Q<\/b>, where <b>I<\/b> denotes the initial state of the coins, <b>N<\/b> denotes the number of coins and rounds, and <b>Q<\/b>, which is either 1, or 2 as explained below.\n\n<p>\nHere <b>I=1<\/b> means all coins are showing <b>Head<\/b> in the start of the game, and <b>I=2<\/b> means all coins are showing <b>Tail<\/b> in the start of the game. <b>Q=1<\/b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Head<\/b> in the end of the game, and <b>Q=2<\/b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Tail<\/b> in the end of the game.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nFor each game, output one integer denoting the total number of coins showing the particular face in the end of the game.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n\n<p>\n<b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10<\/b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 G \u2264 20000<\/b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>9<\/sup><\/b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 I \u2264 2<\/b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2<\/b><br>\n<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n2\n1 5 1\n1 5 2\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n3\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:<\/h3>\n<p>\n<b>In the 1st game in Example:<\/b>\n<b>I=1<\/b>, so initial arrangement of coins are H H H H H,\nand now Elephant will play 5 rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows<br>\nAfter the 1st Round: <b>T<\/b> H H H H<br>\nAfter the 2nd Round: <b>H T<\/b> H H H<br>\nAfter the 3rd Round: <b>T H T<\/b> H H<br>\nAfter the 4th Round: <b>H T H T<\/b> H<br>\nAfter the 5th Round: <b>T H T H T<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFinally <b>Q=1<\/b>, so we need to find the total number of coins showing <b>Head<\/b>, which is <b>2<\/b>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<b>In the 2nd game in Example:<\/b>\nThis is similar to the 1st game, except Elephant needs to find the total number of coins showing <b>Tail<\/b>.\nSo the Answer is <b>3<\/b>.
