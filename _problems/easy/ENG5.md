<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>The Big Billion day has arrived and Ross has $N$  items in his mind which he wants to purchase. 

After purchasing Ross found that he has total of $M$ type items from 1 to $M$. 

Now to distinguish the items from each other he wants to arrange them in such a way that items of same type occur continuously. 

For this he can select any $K$ ( $0$ <= $K$ <= $N$ ) number of items and permute them. The other $N-K$ elements remain untouched. 

Can you help him to find the minimum value of $K$ for which this is possible? 

###Input:

- The first line of the input contains two space separated integer $N$ and $M$
- The second line contains N space-separated integers which denotes the type of items he has bought as 
  $A_1$, $A_2$, . . . . . $A_N$ . 

###Output:

Print a single line containing one integer â€”  minimum value of $K$ for which items of same type occurs continuously. 

###Constraints 
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq M \leq 20$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq M$

###Sample Input:
	6 3
	1 2 3 1 2 3

###Sample Output:
	3
	
###EXPLANATION:
One of the possible way is to select the items at indexes $1st$ , $3rd$ and $5th$.
We can permute the selected items by placing the $1st$ ,$3rd$ and $5th$ items at $3rd$ ,$5th$ and $1st$ places respectively to finally get 2 2 1 1 3 3.
