### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/hindi/HXOR.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/bengali/HXOR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/mandarin/HXOR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/russian/HXOR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/vietnamese/HXOR.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and you have to perform the following operation exactly $X$ times:
- Choose two integers $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i \lt j \le N$.
- Choose a non-negative integer $p$.
- Change $A_i$ to $A_i \oplus 2^p$, and change $A_j$ to $A_j \oplus 2^p$, where $\oplus$ denotes [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Find the lexicographically smallest sequence which can be obtained by performing this operation exactly $X$ times.

A sequence $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than a sequence $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_N$ if there is an index $i$ such that $B_i \lt C_i$ and for each valid $j \lt i$, $B_j = C_j$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $X$. 
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers â€• the lexicographically smallest obtainable sequence.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $2 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le X \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $N \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3 3
2 2 3
```

### Example Output
```
0 0 3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The original sequence is $(2, 2, 3)$. Consider the following three operations:
- Choose $i = 1$, $j = 2$ and $p = 1$. Then, $A_1$ changes from $2$ to $2 \oplus 2^1 = 0$ and similarly, $A_2$ changes from $2$ to $2 \oplus 2^1 = 0$. Now the sequence is $(0, 0, 3)$.
- Next, choose $i = 1$, $j = 2$ and $p = 1$. Then, $A_1$ changes to $0 \oplus 2^1 = 2$ and $A_2$ changes to $0 \oplus 2^1 = 2$. The sequence is $(2, 2, 3)$.
- Next, again choose $i = 1$, $j = 2$ and $p = 1$. Then, $A_1$ changes to $2 \oplus 2^1 = 0$ and $A_2$ changes to $2 \oplus 2^1 = 0$. The sequence is $(0, 0, 3)$ again.

We can check that after exactly 3 operations, this is the lexicographically smallest sequence we can obtain.
