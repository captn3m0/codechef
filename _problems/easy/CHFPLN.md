Chef has an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. For each index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$), Chef needs to divide $A_i$ into two positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x + y = A_i$, then place this as a point $(x, y)$ in the infinite $2$-dimensional coordinate plane. Help Chef to find the maximum number of distinct points that can be put in the plane, if he optimally splits the values $A_i$. Note that Chef can only perform one split for each index.
