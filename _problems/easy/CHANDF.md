Chef got interested in bits and wanted to learn about them, so his friend Pintu gave him a special function $F(X,Y,Z) = (X \wedge Z) \cdot (Y \wedge Z)$, where $\wedge$ is the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) operator and $X, Y, Z$ are non-negative integers.

Pintu wants Chef to maximise the function $F(X,Y,Z)$ for given $X$ and $Y$ by choosing an appropriate $Z$. However, to make it interesting, Pintu also gave Chef limits $L$ and $R$ for $Z$. In other words, he wants Chef to find a non-negative integer $Z$ ($L \le Z \le R$) such that $F(X,Y,Z) = \mathrm{max}_{L \le k \le R} \left( F(X,Y,k) \right)$. If there is more than one such value of $Z$, he should find the smallest one in the range $[L, R]$.

Since Chef is busy cooking in the kitchen, he needs you to help him solve this problem.

Note: $X$, $Y$, $L$ and $R$ are chosen in such a way that $\mathrm{max}_{L \le k \le R} \left( F(X,Y,k) \right)$ never exceeds $2^{62}$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $X$, $Y$, $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest value of $Z$ in the given range that maximises $F$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $0 \le X,Y \le 10^{12}$
- $0 \le L \le R \le 10^{12}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points)**:
- $L = 0$
- $R \ge 2 \cdot \mathrm{max}(X,Y)$

**Subtask #2 (25 points)**: $L = 0$

**Subtask #3 (60 points)**: original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
7 12 4 17
7 12 0 8
```

### Example Output
```
15
7
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1**: Here, $Z = 15$ maximises the function, since $F(7,12,15) = 84$. It is impossible to reach $F \gt 84$ with any $Z$ in the given range.

**Example case 2**: The smallest $Z$ which maximises $F$ is $Z = 7$, and the value of $F$ for this $Z$ is $28$.
