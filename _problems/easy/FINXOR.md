**This is an interactive problem.**

There is a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You do not know this sequence, but your task is to find the value of $A_1 \oplus A_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus A_N$, where $\oplus$ denotes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">bitwise XOR operation</a>.

You may ask up to $20$ questions. In each question, you should choose an integer $K$ ($1 \le K \le 2 \cdot 10^6$) and the interactor responds with the value of $(A_1 \oplus K) + (A_2 \oplus K) + \ldots + (A_N \oplus K)$.

### Interaction
- First, you should read a line containing a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.
- For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer $N$.
- To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers $1$ and $K$, where $1 \le K \le 2 \cdot 10^6$. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer â€• the answer to your question or $-1$ if the question is invalid or you asked more than $20$ questions.
- Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers $2$ and $X$, where $X = A_1 \oplus A_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus A_N$. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: $1$ if your answer was correct or $-1$ if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive an answer $-1$, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^3$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):** $A_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (85 points):** original constraints

### Example
```
You             Grader
                1
                4
1 2
                10
1 5 
                18
2 4
                1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The hidden sequence is $A = [1,2,3,4]$.
- We ask a question with $K = 2$. The grader responds with $A_1 \oplus 2 + A_2 \oplus 2 + A_3 \oplus 2 + A_4 \oplus 2 = 10$.
- Then, we ask a question with $K = 5$ and the grader responds with $A_1 \oplus 5 + A_2 \oplus 5 + A_3 \oplus 5 + A_4 \oplus 5 = 18$.

Therefore, $A_1 \oplus A_2 \oplus A_3 \oplus A_4 = 4$.
