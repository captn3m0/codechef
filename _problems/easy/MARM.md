### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/hindi/MARM.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/bengali/MARM.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/mandarin/MARM.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/russian/MARM.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT19/vietnamese/MARM.pdf) as well.

Chef is really interested in the XOR operation. He wants to take a sequence $A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_{N-1}$ and for each $i$ from $0$ to $K-1$ inclusive (in this order, one by one), perform the following operation:
- Let's denote $a = A_{i\%N}$ and $b = A_{N-(i\%N)-1}$ before this operation.
- Change $A_{i\%N}$ to $a \oplus b$, i.e. $a$ XOR $b$.

Since Chef is busy, he asked you to find the final sequence he should get after performing these operations.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_{N-1}$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers â€• the elements of the final sequence.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 70$
- $1 \le N \le 10^4$
- $1 \le K \le 10^{12}$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le K \le 10^6$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
2 2
1 2
```

### Example Output
```
3 1
```
