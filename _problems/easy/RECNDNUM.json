{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"RECNDNUM","problem_name":"Chef and Walk","body":"Chef is playing a game on the **non-negative** x-axis. It takes him $1$ second to reach from $i^{th}$ position to $(i-1)^{th}$ position or $(i+1)^{th}$ position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop at any moment of time.\r\n\r\nThe movement of chef can be described as follows.\r\n- At the start he is standing at $x=0$ at time $0$.\r\n- In the first round, he moves towards $x=1$ and comes back to the $x=0$ position. \r\n- In the second round, he moves towards the $x=2$ and comes back again to $x=0$. \r\n- Generalizing, in the $k^{th}$ round, he moves from $x=0$ to $x=k$ and then returns back to $x=0$ at the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.\r\n\r\nFor Example, the path of Chef for $3^{rd}$ round is given below.   \r\n$0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0$        \r\n  \r\nThe overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this:   \r\n$0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 3 - \u2026$\r\n\r\nYou are given two **non-negative** integers $N$ and $K$.

Then the test cases follow.\r\n- Each test case contains a single line of two integers $N$ and $K$.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at $x=N$ for the $K^{th}$ time by modulo $1,000,000,007$.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\r\n- $0 \\le N \\le 10^9$\r\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n```\r\n5\r\n0 1\r\n1 1\r\n2 1\r\n1 3\r\n4 6\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n```\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n5\r\n46\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation:\r\n**Test Case 1:**  \r\nChef starts the journey from the $N = 0$ at time $t = 0$ and it's the first time $(K = 1)$, he is here.
