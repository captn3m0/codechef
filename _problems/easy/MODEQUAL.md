### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/mandarin/MODEQUAL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/russian/MODEQUAL.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/vietnamese/MODEQUAL.pdf) and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK131/bengali/MODEQUAL.pdf) as well. 

You are given $N$ non-negative integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You are allowed to perform following operation any number of times:

- Choose any valid index $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$) and a positive integer $M>0$ and replace $A_i$ with $A_i\bmod M$. That is, replace $A_i$ with its remainder when divided by $M$, which is a value between $0$ and $M-1$, inclusive. 
- $M$ does not need to be same between different operations.

Find the minimum number of operations to make all the array elements **equal**.

**Note:** Since the input and output are large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
