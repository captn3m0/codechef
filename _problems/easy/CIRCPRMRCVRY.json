This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le K + 1 \\le N \\le 2K-1$.\n- $0 \\le A_i \\le K$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (50 points):** The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2000$\n**Subtask 2 (50 points):** No additional constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"You are given two integers $N, K$ such that $K + 1 \\le N \\le 2K-1$.
