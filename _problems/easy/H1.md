<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Johnny has some difficulty memorizing the small prime numbers. So, his computer science teacher has asked him to play with the following puzzle game frequently.</p>
<p>The puzzle is a 3x3 board consisting of numbers from 1 to 9. The objective of the puzzle is to swap the tiles until the following final state is reached:</p>
<pre>1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
</pre>
<p>At each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent tiles <b>if their sum is a prime number.</b> Two tiles are considered adjacent if they have a common edge.</p>
<p>Help Johnny to find the shortest number of steps needed to reach the goal state.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 50). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of a 3x3 table describing a puzzle which Johnny would like to solve.</p>
<p>The input data for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print a single line containing the shortest number of steps needed to solve the corresponding puzzle. If there is no way to reach the final state, print the number -1.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
2

7 3 2 
4 1 5 
6 8 9 

9 8 5 
2 4 1 
3 7 6  

<b>Output:</b>
6
-1
</pre>
<h3>Output details</h3>
<p>The possible 6 steps in the first test case are described in the following figure:</p>
