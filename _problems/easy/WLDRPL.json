This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq |S|$\n- $\\sum{|S|}$ and $\\sum{Q}$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask #1 (20 points):**\n- $1 \\leq |S| \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 1000$\n- $\\sum{|S|}$ and $\\sum{Q}$ over all test case does not exceed $10^4$.\n\n**Subtask #2 (80 points):**\n- Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/WLDRPL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/WLDRPL.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/WLDRPL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/WLDRPL.pdf) as well.\n\nA string $S$ whose characters are one of the following 5: $($, $)$, $+$, $-$ and $?$, is said to be a *valid string* if one of the following conditions holds:\n- $S = \\ ?$\n- $S = (x+y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are valid strings.\n- $S = (x-y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are valid strings.\n\nFor example, strings $?$, $(?-?)$, $(?+(?-?))$ are valid strings, while strings $(?-+)$, $??$, $(?)$, $?-?$, $(?+?))$ are not.\n\nThe *power* of a valid string $S$ is defined to be the maximum value attainable by replacing each $?$ in it by either $0$ or $1$ and evaluating the resulting expression.\n\nFor example, the power of $(?-?)$ is $1$ because we can obtain $(1 - 0)$ which evaluates to $1$.\n\nYou are given a valid string $S$, and $Q$ queries on it.
