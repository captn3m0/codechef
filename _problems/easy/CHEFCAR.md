Chef is a great mechanic. As the cost of petrol is increasing day by day he decided to build a water car to take his girlfriend Natasha on a date. Water Car has great build quality but is able to travel only $1$ Km on every $1$ liter of water. To show off his Water Car to Natasha he took her to the formula racing track which is an ($N-1$) km long road with checkpoints numbered $1$ to $N$. Initially, Chef is at checkpoint number $1$. At every checkpoint, there is a Water station but the cost of filling $1$ litre of water at a checkpoint is equal to the checkpoint number. You cannot store more than $V$ litres of water in the tank of a car. Chef is interested in the both minimum as well as maximum cost of filling that can happen to reach the checkpoint number $N$.
