All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY17/mandarin/CHEFSIGN.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY17/russian/CHEFSIGN.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY17/vietnamese/CHEFSIGN.pdf) as well.

Chef found a strange string yesterday - a string of signs **s**, where each sign is either a **', **'='** or a **'&gt;'**. Let N be the length of this string. Chef wants to insert N + 1 positive integers into this sequence and make it valid. A valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer, and the signs are correct. That is, if a sign 'a and followed by an integer *b*, then *a* should be less than *b*. Likewise for the other two signs as well.**

Chef can take some positive integers in the range **\[1, P\]** and use a number in the range as many times as he wants.

Help Chef find the minimum possible **P** with which he can create a valid sequence.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains the string of signs **s**, where each sign is either **', **'='** or a **'&gt;'**.**

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum possible **P**.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ **T, |s|** ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ Sum of **|s|** over all test cases in a single test file ≤ 106

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (30 points)**

- 1 ≤ **T, |s|** ≤ 103
- 1 ≤ Sum of **|s|** over all test cases in a single test file ≤ 104

**Subtask #2 (70 points)**

- Original constraints

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
4

Output:
4
2
2
3
</pre>
### Explanation

Here are some possible valid sequences which can be formed with the minimum **P** for each of the test cases:
