{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"CCBTS04","problem_name":"Students, heights and their IQs","body":"In the school morning assembly, $n$ students standing in a line. You, being the principal of the school know the heights and IQ levels of the students. This information is provided to you by an array $h$ and $iq$, where $h_i, iq_i$ denotes the height and the IQ of the $i$-th student, respectively. \r\n\r\nYou want to find the longest subsequence of the students such that their heights are in strictly increasing order, whereas their IQ levels in strictly decreasing order. Note that a subsequence is gotten by removing some (possibly zero) students from the line.\r\n\r\nFind out the length of longest such subsequence.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$. \r\n- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n$.\r\n- The third line contains $n$ space-separated integers $iq_1, iq_2, \\dots, iq_n$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 5$\r\n- $1 \\le n \\le 10^3$\r\n- $1 \\le h_i, iq_i \\le 10^9$\r\n\r\n### Sample Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n3 2 1\r\n4\r\n1 3 2 4\r\n5 6 4 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\n```\r\n3\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** You can choose the subsequence {1, 2, 3} of the students. You can see the heights of the students are increasing from left to right, whereas the IQ levels are decreasing.\r\n\r\n**Example case 2:** You can choose the subsequence {2, 4} of the students. You can see the height of 4-th student is 4, which is greater than the height of 2-nd student (3). The IQ levels of 4-th student (4) is less than the 2nd student (6). Hence, the answer is 2.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"In the school morning assembly, $n$ students standing in a line.
