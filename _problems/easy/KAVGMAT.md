Chef found a matrix $A$ with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$), where for each row $r$ and column $c$, the cell in row $r$ and column $c$ (denoted by $(r,c)$) contains an integer $A_{r,c}$.

This matrix has two interesting properties:
- The integers in each row form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid $i$, $A_{i,1} \leq A_{i,2} \leq \ldots \leq A_{i,M}$.
- The integers in each column also form a non-decreasing sequence, i.e. for each valid $j$, $A_{1,j} \leq A_{2,j} \leq \ldots \leq A_{N,j}$.

A $K$-worthy [submatrix](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Submatrix.html) is a square submatrix of $A$, i.e. a submatrix with $l$ rows and $l$ columns, for any integer $l$, such that the average of all the integers in this submatrix is $\geq K$. 

Chef wants you to find the number of $K$-worthy submatrices of $A$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains $M$ space-separated integers $A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, A_{i,3}, \ldots, A_{i,M}$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of $K$-worthy submatrices of $A$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \cdot M \leq 10^6$
- $N \leq M$
- $0 \leq K \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq A_{r,c} \leq 10^9$ for each valid $r,c$
- the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):** the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$

**Subtask #2 (25 points):** the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \cdot 10^5$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3 3 4
2 2 3
3 4 5
4 5 5
```

### Example Output
```
7
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The following are the seven $4$-worthy submatrices:
- $ 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 4 \\
4 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
with average $4$; this matrix occurs only once
- $
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 5 \\
5 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
with average $4.75$; this matrix also occurs only once
- $
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
with average $4$; we find this matrix twice in $A$
- $
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
with average $5$; we find this matrix $3$ times in $A$
