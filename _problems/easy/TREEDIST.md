You are given a tree consisting of $N$ nodes. The nodes are numbered from $1$ to $N$. The tree is rooted at the node $1$. 

A tree is a connected undirected graph with $N âˆ’ 1$ edges.

Find the sum of the distance between nodes $x$ and $y$ over all tuples ($u, v, x, y$) satisfying the following conditions:

$1)$ $u \lt v$

$2)$ $u$ is the ancestor of node $x$ and $v$ is the ancestor of node $y$.

$3)$ Neither of $u$ or $v$ is the ancestor of the other.

Since the sum can be enormous, print it modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.

**Note**:
- The distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.

- Node $x$ is considered to be the ancestor of $y$ if $x$ lies on the path from $1$ to $y$.

- Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include [this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15866) in your code.
