At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named \"Boats! Boats! Boats!\". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to <b>N<\/b>, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThere are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows: \n<ul>\n<li>A box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.<\/li>\n<li>A box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.<\/li>\n<li>A box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nObviously a cookie can be put into a single box.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFor each player, you know the number of cookies in his storage (denoted by <b>c[i]<\/b>), also the types of cookies in the storage given denoted by <b>type[i][j]<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nYour task is to determine the winner of this game. Output \"tie\" if there are two or more players with same maximum score, \"chef\" if only Chef has a maximum score, winner's index in all other cases.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input contains a single integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.

Also, he can put all his cookies (as they are all distinct) in a bag of size 6. It will fetch him additional 4 points. So, Chef's total points will be 10.<\/p>\n<p>The second player has 9 cookies, he gets 9 points for that. Other than this, he can't create a bag with either 4, 5 or 6 distinct cookies.
