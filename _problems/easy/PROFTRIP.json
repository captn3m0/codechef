The country where they live is a federation of $N$ states (numbered $1$ through $N$) with $R$ bidirectional interstate roads connecting them. For each road, we know the amount of fuel the Professor needs to traverse it; travelling within a state consumes no fuel. For each $i$, the price of fuel in state $i$ is fixed at $F_i$ units of money per litre.\n\nDespite Professor's outstanding talent and his great scientific prowess, he has some bad habits as well: he is too penny-wise, so he carries huge barrels in his car in order to store extra petrol and avoid buying petrol in expensive states. Therefore, he is able to carry any amount of fuel he wants at any moment during the trip, and he is also fine with visiting the same state more than once on the trip if it saves him money. The Professor starts the trip without any fuel.\n\nHelp the Professor find the minimum possible amount of money he should spend on fuel in order to travel from state $P$ to state $Q$.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

This way, he spends $30$ units of money. However, the optimal solution is to buy $4$ litres of petrol in state $1$, travel to state $2$, then to state $3$, buy $8$ litres of petrol in state $3$ and then travel to state $4$, since this costs only $28$ units of money.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME74\/hindi\/PROFTRIP.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME74\/bengali\/PROFTRIP.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME74\/mandarin\/PROFTRIP.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME74\/russian\/PROFTRIP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME74\/vietnamese\/PROFTRIP.pdf) as well.\n\nThe Professor is going on a trip with his family this weekend.
