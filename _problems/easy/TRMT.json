This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1\\le T\\le 10^3$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 2\\cdot10^5$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 2\\cdot10^5$\n- $1 \\le A_i,W_i \\le 10^4$\n- $1\\le u_i,v_i,x_i,y_i\\le N$\n- $x_i\\ne y_i$\n- $u_i\\ne v_i$\n- The sum of $N$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n- The sum of $Q$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask #1 (20 points):** $u_i=i,v_i=i+1$\n- **Subtask #2 (80 points):** Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Given is a tree with $N$ weighted vertices and $N-1$ weighted edges.
