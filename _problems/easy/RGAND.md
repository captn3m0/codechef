You are given positive integers $L$ and $R$. You have to find the sum
$$S = \sum_{i=L}^R \left(L \wedge (L+1) \wedge \ldots \wedge i\right) \,,$$
where $\wedge$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Since the sum could be large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the sum $S$ modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{18}$

### Example Input
```
2
1 4
4 10
```

### Example Output
```
1
16
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The sum is 1 + 1 AND 2 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 + 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

**Example case 2:** The sum is 4 + 4 AND 5 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 + 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND 7 + ... + 4 AND 5 AND ... AND 10 = 4 + 4 + ... + 0 = 16.
