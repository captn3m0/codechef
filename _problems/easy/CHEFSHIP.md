In Chefland, each person has their own non-empty personal string. When two people with personal strings $T_1$ and $T_2$ (possibly identical) become friends in Chefland, their strings are replaced by a new string $S = T_1 + T_1 + T_2 + T_2$, where $+$ denotes string concatenation.

Chef recently became friends with Chefina. However, Chefina's personal string was her favourite and she got upset when it was replaced by $S$. She wanted her personal string back. Chef does not remember $T_1$ and $T_2$ now, he only knows $S$.

Find the number of ways in which Chef can retrieve valid strings $T_1$ and $T_2$ from the given string $S$. It is also possible that Chef does not remember $S$ correctly, in which case there is no way to retrieve $T_1$ and $T_2$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of ways to retrieve $T_1$ and $T_2$ from $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $4 \le |S| \le 10^5$
- $|S|$ is divisible by $2$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters
- the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$

### Example Input
```
3
abcd
aaaa
ababcdccdc
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
1
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There is no way to choose $T_1$ and $T_2$.

**Example case 2:** Both $T_1$ and $T_2$ must be "a".
