For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence $A = [1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11]$, the median is equal to $4$, and for $A = [2, 3, 4, 5]$, the median is equal to $(3+4)\/2 = 3.5$.\n\nFulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence $A$ with length $N$:\n```\nread(N)\nread(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])\nsort(A)\n# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A\n# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged\nremove(A[K], A[N mod K])\nreturn A[(N-2)\/2] # integer division\n```\n\nThe program takes an integer $K$ as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive.\n\nLittle Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence $A = [34, 23, 35, 514]$, which is a counterexample for any $K \\le 3$), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters $S, K, m, M$ (in addition to $N$) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest *proper* sequence $A$ with length $N$ as a counterexample.\n\nWe say that a sequence $A$ with length $N$ ($0$-indexed) is *proper* if it satisfies the following conditions:\n- it contains only positive integers\n- $A_0 + A_1 +A_2 + \\dots + A_{N-1} = S$\n- $m \\le A_i \\le M$ for each $0 \\le i \\lt N$\n- the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter $K$, is different from the correct median of the sequence $A$\n\nCan you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers \u2014 the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 8$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N-1$\n- $1 \\le S \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le m \\le M \\le S$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n3 6 1 1 5\n4 4 2 1 3\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1 1 4\n-1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** For the sequence $A = [1, 1, 4]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements ($K=1$, $N\\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.\n\n**Example case 2:** The only possible sequence is $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer $1$ for it.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"allllekssssa","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>allllekssssa<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"13-08-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/allllekssssa'>allllekssssa<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/constructive'>constructive<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook-off'>cook-off<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook97'>cook97<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/greedy'>greedy<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/median'>median<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/taran_1407'>taran_1407<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/HACKFU","time":{"view_start_date":1534703400,"submit_start_date":1534703400,"visible_start_date":1534703400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472947},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
