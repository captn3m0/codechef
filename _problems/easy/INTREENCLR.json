This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq U,V \\leq N$\n- The given edges form a tree\n- The sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $1.5\\cdot 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask $1$ (12 points)** : $N \\leq 250$, $Q = N^2$\n- **Subtask $2$ (20 points)** : $Q = 3N$\n- **Subtask $3$ (20 points)** : $Q = 2N$\n- **Subtask $4$ (48 points)** : $Q = \\bigg\\lfloor\\dfrac{3N}{2}\\bigg\\rfloor$\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"**This is an interactive problem.**\n\nYou are given a tree having $N$ nodes. Each node of this tree is colored either Black or White but you don't know the initial color of any node. \n\nYou can ask up to $Q$ queries. In each query, you will give a node to the grader. The grader will flip the color of this node and then return the number of edges in the tree connecting nodes of different colors. Note that the flipping of color is **permanent**, meaning that the color of the node remains flipped after the query. \n\nYour task is to make the color of all nodes the same.\n\n### Interaction\nFirst, read a line containing a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, first read a line containing two integers $N$ and $Q$ denoting the number of nodes and the maximum number of queries allowed.\n\nThen read $N-1$ lines each containing two integers $U$ and $V$ denoting that there is an edge between nodes $U$ and $V$.\n\nThen you may ask up to $Q$ queries. For each query, print a line containing a single integer $X$ ($1\\leq X\\leq N$). Then read a line containing a single integer $Y$. If you ask an invalid query or exceed $Q$ queries then $Y=-1$, otherwise $Y$ will be the answer to the query. If you receive $Y=-1$, terminate the program immediately to get the Wrong Answer verdict, otherwise you may get any verdict.\n\nOnce you are done asking all queries, print a line containing the integer $0$ and then read a line containing a single integer denoting the verdict for the test case. If all nodes have the same color, the grader will return $1$, else $-1$. If you get $-1$, terminate the program immediately.
