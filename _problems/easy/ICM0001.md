The match is set and your team is ready to win!
<br>
The team has $N$ players, each with the ability $A_i$.
<br><br>
But you are not happy with the given playing order. You are wondering how to create a new order so that the player with lesser ability go earlier, i.e., in <b>non-decreasing order</b>.
<br><br>
In one move, you can break a suffix of <b>any</b> length of the array and attach it to the front. You can do the move as many times as you like.
<br>
For example, the Array $A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$ can become $A = [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ in one move by breaking and reattaching the suffix of length $2$.
<br><br>
For each testcase, if the array can be sorted non-decreasingly, print YES and the <b>minimum</b> number of moves to do so. Otherwise, print NO.
<hr>
<h3> Input </h3>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
<li>Each testcase contains two lines. The first line has a single integer $N$, denoting the number of players in the team.
<li>The second list has $N$ space-separated integers of the array $A$, where $A_i$ represents the ability of the $i^{th}$ player
</ul> 
<hr>
<h3> Output </h3>
Print a single line containing the string "YES" if the string can be sorted or "NO" if it does not (without quotes). If answer is yes, print a second line containing a single integer, the minimum number of moves.
<br>
You may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
<hr>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li> $1 ≤ T, N ≤ 3 \cdot 10^{5}$
<li> $0 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^{9}$
<li> The sum of all $N$ over all testcases $T$, does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^{5}$.
</ul>
 <hr>
<h3>Example Input</h3>
2<br>
2<br>
1 2<br>
3<br>
2 1 3<br>
<hr>
<h3>Example Output</h3>
YES<br>
0<br>
NO<br>
<hr>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<b>Example Case 1:</b> The array is already sorted non-decreasingly. Hence, 0 moves required.<br>
<b>Example Case 2:</b> We cannot satisfy the condition for the given array. Hence, answer is NO.
