### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/LNGSUB.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/bengali/LNGSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/LNGSUB.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/LNGSUB.pdf) as well.

You are given $N$ strings $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$. Consider a complete undirected graph with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$), in which the weight of an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ is equal to the length of the longest common substring of $S_u$ and $S_v$.

Find the maximum possible weight of a spanning tree of this graph.
