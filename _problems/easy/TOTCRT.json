In one challenge, there are $N$ problems in each division, but some problems may be shared among multiple divisions. Each problem is uniquely identified by a *code* \u2014 a string containing only uppercase English letters. Each participant can only submit in one of the divisions.\n\nChef wants to find the number of correct solutions, in total among all $3$ divisions, for each problem. Given a list of $N$ problem codes with the numbers of correct solutions for each problem in each division, find the total number of correct solutions for each problem and sort them in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string $S_{3,i}$ followed by a space and an integer $C_{3,i}$ \u2014 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the $i$-th problem in the third division.\n- $N$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string $S_{2,i}$ followed by a space and an integer $C_{2,i}$ \u2014 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the $i$-th problem in the second division.\n- Finally, $N$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string $S_{1,i}$ followed by a space and an integer $C_{1,i}$ \u2014 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the $i$-th problem in the first division.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, let $P$ be the number of distinct problems; you should print $P$ space-separated integers \u2014 the number of solutions for each of these problems, sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq |S_{1,i}|, |S_{2,i}|, |S_{3,i}| \\leq 8$ for each valid $i$\n- $S_{1,i}, S_{2,i}, S_{3,i}$ contain only uppercase English letters for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\leq C_{1,i}, C_{2,i}, C_{3,i} \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^8$ for each valid $i$\n- the problem codes in each division are pairwise distinct, but some problem codes may appear in multiple divisions\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n1\nA 1\nB 2\nC 3\n2\nAA 1\nAB 1\nAB 1\nAC 1\nAC 1\nAD 1\n1\nZ 100\nZ 100\nZ 100\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1 2 3\n1 1 2 2\n300\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** There is only $1$ problem in each division and no problems are shared among divisions, so the total number of distinct problems is $3$ and the numbers of solutions are: $1$ for \"A\", $2$ for \"B\", $3$ for \"C\".\n\n**Example case 2:** There are $2$ problems in each division and each pair of consecutive divisions shares $1$ problem, so the total number of distinct problems is $4$ and the numbers of solutions are: $1$ for \"AA\", $2$ for \"AB\", $2$ for \"AC\", $1$ for \"AD\". We need to sort them in non-decreasing order, so the final answer is $(1, 1, 2, 2)$.\n\n**Example case 3:** There is only $1$ problem \"Z\" in the entire contest, shared among all divisions, and the number of solutions for it is $300$. \n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/START5\/mandarin\/TOTCRT.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/START5\/russian\/TOTCRT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/START5\/vietnamese\/TOTCRT.pdf) as well.\n\nCodechef challenges have three divisions.
