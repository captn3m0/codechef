Chef has a machine which he uses to rotate sequences. If he puts a sequence $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$ into the machine, it produces the sequence $S_2, S_3, \ldots, S_N, S_1$, i.e. the first element of the sequence is moved to the end.

Chef is definitely not a newbie â€• he knows about trivial things like finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. Therefore, he now made a difficult problem to challenge himself:

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. For each $k$ ($0 \le k \le N-1$), consider the sequence produced by inserting it into the machine repeatedly $k$ times (i.e. inserting $A$ into the machine and replacing $A$ by the sequence it produces, $k$ times); find the maximum sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of this sequence.

However, to solve this problem, Chef needs the help of a pro. Solve it for him. 

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers should denote the largest sum of a non empty contiguous subsequence of the sequence produced by the machine after $i-1$ repeated insertions.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $|A_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

### Example Input
```
1
4
-5 4 1 2
```

### Example Output
```
7 7 4 5
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:**
- After zero insertions, $A = [-5, 4, 1, 2]$. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is $A = [4, 1, 2]$.
- After one insertion, $A = [4, 1, 2, -5]$. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is $A = [4, 1, 2]$.
- After two insertions, $A = [1, 2, -5, 4]$. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is $A = [4]$.
- After three insertions, $A = [2, -5, 4, 1]$. The contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum is $A = [4, 1]$.
