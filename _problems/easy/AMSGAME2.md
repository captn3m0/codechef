All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is playing a game on a sequence of **N** positive integers, say **A1, A2, ... AN**. The game is played as follows.

- If all the numbers are equal, the game ends.
- Otherwise 
    - Select two numbers which are unequal
    - Subtract the smaller number from the larger number
    - Replace the larger number with the result from above

Chef has already figured out that the game **always terminates**. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the **same value**, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him if the game terminates on **1**.

In fact, there may be many such games. Given a sequence of integers Chef wants to know the number of **sub-sequences** of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on **1**. A **sub-sequence** can be obtained from the original sequence by **deleting 0 or more** integers from the original sequence. See the explanation section for clarity.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T**, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of **T** test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N**, the length of the sequence. The second line contains **N** positive integers, each separated by a single space.

### Output

For each test case, **output a single integer** - the number of **sub-sequences** of the original sequence, such that, playing the game on the **sub-sequence** results in ending the game with all the values equal to **1**.

### Constraints

**1 ≤ T ≤ 100**
**1 ≤ N ≤ 60**
**1 ≤ Ai ≤ 104**
**All Ai will be distinct.**

### Explanation

**Test Case 1:** The following 11 sub-sequences are counted.

- { 2, 3 }
- { 2, 5 }
- { 2, 7 }
- { 3, 5 }
- { 3, 7 }
- { 5, 7 }
- { 2, 3, 5 }
- { 2, 3, 7 }
- { 2, 5, 7 }
- { 3, 5, 7 }
- { 2, 3, 5, 7 }

**Test Case 2:** The following 7 sub-sequences are counted.

- { 3, 4 }
- { 3, 8 }
- { 3, 16 }
- { 3, 4, 8 }
- { 3, 4, 16 }
- { 3, 8, 16 }
- { 3, 4, 8, 16 }

**Test Case 3:** There are 8 subsequences of { 6, 10, 15 }

- {} =&gt; The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence
- { 6 } =&gt; The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence
- { 10 } =&gt; The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence
- { 15 } =&gt; The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence
- { 6, 10 } =&gt; The game cannot end at { 1, 1 }
- { 6, 15 } =&gt; The game cannot end at { 1, 1 }
- { 10, 15 } =&gt; The game cannot end at { 1, 1 }
- { 6, 10, 15 } =&gt; The game ends at { 1, 1, 1 }. Hence this is the only sub-sequence that is counted in the result.
