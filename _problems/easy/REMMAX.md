<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>### Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/hindi/REMMAX.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/bengali/REMMAX.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/mandarin/REMMAX.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/russian/REMMAX.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME72/vietnamese/REMMAX.pdf) as well.

Abdullah has invented a machine for converting money. When $X$ units of money are inserted into this machine, it produces $\mathrm{Reverse}\,(X)$ units of money. where $\mathrm{Reverse}\,(X)$ denotes the decimal number obtained by reversing the decimal representation of $X$ (without leading zeroes). For example:
- $\mathrm{Reverse}\,(123) = 321$, since the reverse of "123" is "321"
- $\mathrm{Reverse}\,(460) = 64$, since the reverse of "460" is "064", which is $64$ in decimal representation

The machine is highly unstable and it can be used only once. Abdullah has $N$ units of money, so he is wondering: how much money should he insert into the machine such that the amount of money produced by the machine is maximum possible? The amount of money inserted into the machine must be an integer between $1$ and $N$ inclusive.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the amount of money Abdullah should insert into the machine.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{10,000}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le N \le 10^4$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
23
7
```

### Example Output
```
19
7
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Inserting $X=19$ units of money gives Abdullah $91$ units of money.

**Example case 2:** Inserting $X=7$ units of money gives Abdullah $7$ units of money.
