### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/russian/ODDBITS.pdf) and [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START7/mandarin/ODDBITS.pdf).

Find the minimum integer $K$ such that sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of all integers from $1$ to $K$ is greater than or equal to $N$.

The bits are enumerated from left to right starting from the leftmost set bit i.e. the most significant bit. For example, binary representation of $77$ is **1**0**0**1**1**0**1**. Bits present on $1^{st}$, $3^{rd}$, $5^{th}$ and $7^{th}$ positions in the binary representation are $1, 0, 1, 1$ respectively. So sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of $77$ is $1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3$.
