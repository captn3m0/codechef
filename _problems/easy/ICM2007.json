{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"ICM2007","problem_name":"Conservative Graph","body":"You are given a graph with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges. Each edge has a value associated with it. There are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph. \r\n\r\nEach edge connects two nodes. The cost of going from the first node of the edge to the second via the edge is equal to the value of the edge whereas the cost of going in the reverse direction is equal to the negative of it.\r\n\r\nYour task is to figure out if the graph is conservative or not. A graph is conservative if and only if for each pair of nodes, the cost of reaching the one node from the other is the same via all possible paths. The cost of a path is simply the sum of the costs of each edge in the path.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.
