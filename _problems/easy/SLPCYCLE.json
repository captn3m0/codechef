He divides a day into $L$ units of time (numbered $1$ through $L$). Chef's research shows that his body requires spending only $H$ continuous units of time per day on sleep \u2014 then, he can stay active during work. However, in case of travel or any other responsibilities, he might not be able to achieve this ideal state.\n\nNext, Chef noticed that if he sleeps for $x$ ($x \\lt H$) continuous units of time and then performs some other activity, he can still meet his daily sleep quota, but the remaining time he needs to spend on continuously sleeping becomes $2\\cdot(H-x)$. He can further split this sleeping time in the same way, i.e. if he now sleeps for $y$ more ($y \\lt 2\\cdot(H-x)$) continuous units of time, his required sleeping time becomes $2\\cdot(2\\cdot(H-x)-y)$, and so on.\n\nYou are given a string $S$ with length $L$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is '0' if the $i$-th unit of time is free (so Chef can use it to sleep) or '1' if it is occupied.\n\nCan Chef ever get enough sleep to feel fresh during his work, given that he can choose when to sleep in his free time?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
