All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is good at making pancakes. Generally he gets requests to serve **N** pancakes at once. He serves them in the form of a stack. A pancake can be treated as a circular disk with some radius.

Chef needs to take care that when he places a pancake on the top of the stack the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than **1**. Additionally all radii should be positive integers, and the bottom most pancake should have its radius as **1**. Chef wants you to find out in how many ways can he create a stack containing **N** pancakes.

**Input**

First line of the input contains **T (T &lt;= 1000)** denoting the number of test cases.

**T** lines follow each containing a single integer **N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000)** denoting the size of the required stack.

**Output**

For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size **N** can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo **1000000007**.
