In a *red-blue tree*, each vertex is either red or blue and adjacent vertices always have different colours.

You are given a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). It is not necessarily a red-blue tree, but its vertices are still coloured red and blue. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colours.

Find the smallest number of operations required to transform the tree into a red-blue tree or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N-1$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge.
- The last line contains a string $S$ with length $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is either '0' if the $i$-th vertex is initially red or '1' if it is initially blue.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest number of operations or $-1$ if it is impossible to transform the tree into a red-blue tree.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$  
- $1 \le N \le 100,000$  
- $1 \le u, v \le N$  
- $S$ contains only characters '0' and '1'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Example Input
```
1  
7  
1 2  
1 3  
2 4  
2 5  
3 6  
3 7  
0010010
```

### Example Output
```
3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We can perform the following operations:
- Swap the colours of vertices $1$ and $3$; the string of colours becomes "1000010".
- Swap the colours of vertices $1$ and $2$; the string of colours becomes "0100010".
- Swap the colours of vertices $6$ and $3$; the string of colours becomes "0110000", so the tree is a red-blue tree.
