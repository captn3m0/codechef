### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK123/hindi/DECREM.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK123/mandarin/DECREM.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK123/russian/DECREM.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK123/vietnamese/DECREM.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK123/bengali/DECREM.pdf) as well.

You are given two integers $L$ and $R$. Find the smallest non-negative integer $N$ such that
$$N \,\%\, L \gt N \,\%\, (L + 1) \gt \ldots \gt N \,\%\, (R - 1) \gt N \,\%\, R \,.$$

Here, $\%$ is the modulo operator, so $A \,\%\, B$ is the remainder of $A$ after division by $B$. For example, $11 \,\%\, 3 = 2$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest possible $N$, or $-1$ if no solution exists.

It is guaranteed that when a solution exists, the smallest solution does not exceed $10^{18}$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \lt R \le 10^6$

### Example Input
```
2
4 6
1 2
```
### Example Output
```
6
-1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** $N = 6$ satisfies the given condition, since $6 \,\%\, 4 \,(= 2) \gt 6 \,\%\, 5 \,(= 1) \gt 6 \,\%\, 6 \,(= 0)$. Notice that $N = 7$ also satisfies the condition, but it is larger.

**Example case 2:** It is impossible to find a valid solution because for any non-negative integer $N$, we have $N \,\%\, 1 \,(= 0) \le N \,\%\, 2$.
