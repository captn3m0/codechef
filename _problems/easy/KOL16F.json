The shopkeeper has shown him a chain made of some expensive stones. The chain has <b>n<\/b> stones marked from <b>0<\/b> to <b>n-1<\/b>. The <b>i<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> stone is connected with <b>((i+1)%n)<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> stone for each <b>0 \u2264 i &lt; n<\/b>. Each stone can be either Ruby or Amber.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nemo defines beauty factor <b>B<\/b> of a chain as the maximum number of consecutive stones of same type. <\/p>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/upload\/ACM16KOL\/F.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\">\n\n<p>In the chain above, the beauty factor is <b>B = 4<\/b> because there are <b>4<\/b> consecutive Amber in the chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nemo wants to chose <b>exactly one<\/b> stone <b>i<\/b> and exchange it with a stone with different type. So if the <b>i<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> stone is ruby, Nemo will exchange it with Amber and vice-versa. He wants to do it in such a way that the value <b>B<\/b> is as small as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given the configuration of the chain, can you find the minimum value of <b>B<\/b> that Nemo can get after exchanging <b>exactly one<\/b> stone? Note that, It\u2019s not allowed to change positions of the stones, the new stone must be placed in the same position as the original stone. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>First line contains number of test cases <b>T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 2500)<\/b>. For each test cases, there is a single line containing a string <b>S (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 10<sup>5<\/sup>)<\/b> denoting the chain.  Here |S| denotes the length or number of characters in the string. The string is made of only <b>\u2019R\u2019<\/b> (Ruby) and <b>\u2019A\u2019<\/b> (Amber). Total number of characters in the input file will be less than <b>5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup><\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the case number and the answer in a single line. Look at the output for sample input for details.<\/p>\n<h3>Sample<\/h3> <pre><b>Input<\/b>\n<p>2\nRRRAAAARAA\nARRRRAAA\n<\/p>\n<b>Output for Sample Input<\/b>\n<p>Case 1: 3\nCase 2: 4\n<\/p><\/pre>\n<h3>Explanation:<\/h3>\n\n<p>Case <b>1<\/b> represents the figure in the problem statement. Nemo can exchange one Amber with a Ruby and reduce <b>B<\/b> to <b>3<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/upload\/ACM16KOL\/F2.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\">\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.4","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kol_adm","problem_author_html_handle":"kol_adm","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"21-12-2016","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kol_adm'>\n                    kol_adm\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1482831600,"submit_start_date":1482831600,"visible_start_date":1482831600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493558158},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}
