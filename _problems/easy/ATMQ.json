The order of the people in the queue will be $[2, 3, 4, 5]$ after $1$ leaves. Now people start overtaking ($2^{nd}$ step of the process). Since $3$ is the $2^{nd}$ person in the queue and $2$ is in front of him and $A_2$ < $A_3$, $3$ will overtake $2$. The order of the people in the queue will become $[3, 2, 4, 5]$. Now $4$ is the $3^{rd}$ person in the queue and $2$ is in front of him. But $A_2$ > $A_4$, so there will be no overtaking here. Finally, $5$ is the $4^{th}$ person and $4$ is in front of him. And since $A_4$ < $A_5$, $5$ will overtake $4$ and The order of the people in the queue will be $[3, 2, 5, 4]$ after the $1$st second.\n\n- During the $2^{nd}$ second, $3$ is in front of the queue. He will use the ATM and leave. The order of the people in the queue will become $[2, 5, 4]$. Since $5$ is the $2^{nd}$ person in the queue with $2$ in front of him and $A_2$ < $A_5$, $5$ will overtake $2$ and the order of the people in the queue becomes $[5, 2, 4]$. Now $4$ is the $3^{rd}$ person in the queue. But $A_2$ > $A_4$, so $4$ can't overtake $2$. By the end of $2^{nd}$ second, the order of people in the queue is $[5, 2, 4$].\n\n- During the $3^{rd}$ second, $5$ is in front of the queue. He will use the ATM and leave. After this, the queue will be $2, 4$. And since $A_2$ > $A_4$, there will be no overtaking.\n\n- During the $4^{th}$ second, $2$ uses the ATM and leaves. \n\n- During the $5^{th}$ second, $4$ uses the ATM and leaves.\n\nHence, $1, 2, 3, 4$ and $5$ use the ATM at $1, 4, 2, 5, 3$ second, respectively.","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/J3sLunJA6gM","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"akashbhalotia","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>akashbhalotia<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"11-09-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/akashbhalotia'>akashbhalotia<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/start11'>start11<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/ATMQ","time":{"view_start_date":1631727002,"submit_start_date":1631727002,"visible_start_date":1631727002,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797766},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=ATMQ","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
