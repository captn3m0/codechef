So the location of $3^{rd}$ point becomes $(- 4 + 4, 5) = (0, 5)$.\n\n- In the third operation, you choose $i = 3$, and $K = -5$ and apply the second type of operation. So the location of $3^{rd}$ point becomes $(0, 5 - 5) = (0, 0)$.\n\nHence after the above operations, the location of the given three points becomes equal to each other.\n\n**Test case $2$** : \n- In the first operation, you choose $i = 1$ and $K = 1$ and apply the first type of operation.
