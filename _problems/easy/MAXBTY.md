Chef's fans want to celebrate the special occasion of his birthday, so they are writing letters to him. Chef has received $N$ such letters from $N$ fans (numbered $1$ through $N$). Initially, for each valid $i$, he assigned a *beauty* $B_i$ to the letter from the $i$-th fan (these values may even be negative, for letters that are not written well).

Now, Chef wants you to process $Q$ queries on these letters. There are two types of queries:
- `Q x y`: Chef wants to choose integers $l$ and $r$ such that $1 \le l \le x \le y \le r \le N$ and read all the letters from fans $l, l+1, \ldots, r$. Find the maximum possible value of the sum of beauties of the letters he reads.
- `U x v`: Chef reevaluates the beauty of the letter from the $x$-th fan. The new value of $B_x$ becomes $v$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines describes a query in the format described above.

### Output
For each query of the first type, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum sum of beauties.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $|B_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $|v| \le 10^9$
- $1 \le x \le y \le N$

### Example Input
```
1
5 5
-1 2 -2 1 -3
Q 3 5
Q 2 4
U 1 1
Q 2 4
Q 3 5
```

### Example Output
```
-2
1
2
-1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** For the first query, Chef should read the letters from fans $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$.
