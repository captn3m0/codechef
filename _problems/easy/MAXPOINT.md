Cooking Examinations Authority (C.E.A.) is conducting an Ordinary Cooking Level (O.C.L.) test, which tests the candidate skills on three different aspects - Appearance, Flavor and Texture. Chef is planning to appear in this coveted test.

O.C.L. is a **$240$** $\textbf{minute}$ test consisting of $20$ $\textbf{problems}$ on $\textbf{each aspect}$ (and hence total $60$ problems).

Chef figured out that for $\textbf{each}$ problem on Appearance, Flavor and Texture
- He requires $A, B$ and $C$ minutes respectively to correctly solve that problem. 
- He will be awarded $X, Y$ and $Z$ points respectively when correctly solved that problem. 

Chef wonders what are the maximum points $P$ that he can get in O.C.L.? Can you help the Chef?
