### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/mandarin/CAMC.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/vietnamese/CAMC.pdf) as well.

Chef placed $N$ boxes (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th box contains $A_i$ balls. 

Then, Chef painted the boxes using $M$ distinct colours in such a way that for each $M$ consecutive boxes, no two of these boxes have the same colour.

Help Chef choose $M$ distinct boxes (not necessarily consecutive) such that no two of the chosen boxes have the same colour and the difference between the number of balls in a box that contains the maximum number of balls and a box that contains the minimum number of balls among the chosen boxes is the smallest possible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum possible difference between the maximum and minimum number of balls in the chosen boxes.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $2 \le M \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$, for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $N \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1   
4 2  
10 20 15 28
```

### Example Output
```
5
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Let's denote the colours by 'R' (red) and 'G' (green). There are two possible ways of painting the boxes: "RGRG" and  "GRGR".

There are four ways to choose two boxes (one red and one green box). The numbers of balls in them and the differences are:
- $(10, 28)$ with difference $28-10=18$
- $(10, 20)$ with difference $20-10=10$
- $(15, 28)$ with difference $28-15=13$
- $(15, 20)$ with difference $20-15=5$, which is the smallest possible
