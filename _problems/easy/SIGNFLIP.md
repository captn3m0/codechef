Chef has an array $A$ containing $N$ integers. The integers of the array can be positive, negative, or even zero.

Chef allows you to choose at most $K$ elements of the array and multiply them by $-1$.

Find the **maximum** sum of a subsequence you can obtain if you choose the elements of the subsequence optimally. 

**Note**: A sequence $a$ is a *subsequence* of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, $[3,1]$ is a subsequence of $[3,2,1]$ and $[4,3,1]$, but not a subsequence of $[1,3,3,7]$ and $[3,10,4]$. Note that empty sequence is also a subsequence.
