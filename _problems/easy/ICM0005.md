Coach Chef has selected all the players and now he has to separate them into 2 teams, $A$ and $B$.<br><br>
Each player must be included in <b>exactly one</b> of the 2 teams and each player $x$, has a skill level $S_x$. It is <b>not</b> necessary for both teams to have equal number of players, but <b>they have to be non-empty</b>.<br><br>
Since the number of players is way too high, Chef doesn't have an actual list of every player individually. Instead, he keeps a list of $N$ pairs $ \{ X_i, Y_i \} $, which tells him that there are $Y_i$ players with skill level $X_i$.
<br><br>
Chef thinks that a division into 2 teams is Good, if the skill value of <b>every</b> player in A divides the skill value of <b>every</b> player in B. More formally, $S_b \bmod S_a = 0$, ∀ a ∈ A, b ∈ B.
<br><br>
Since he is busy, can you help him find total number of Good divisions? Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $998244353$.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE :</b> 2 divisions are considered different if there exists any player $x$ belonging to different teams in the 2 divisions. (See example for more clarity).

<h3> Input </h3>
<ul>
    <li>The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of
        $T$ test cases follows.
    <li>The first line for each testcase has a single integer $N$, denoting the number of pairs in Chef's list. 
    <li>$N$ lines follow. Each contains 2 space separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$, denoting Chef has $Y_i$ players with skill level $X_i$.
</ul>

<h3> Output </h3>
Output one integer for every testcase. The number of total Good divisions, modulo $998244353$.
<hr>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
    <li> $1 ≤ T, N ≤ 10^{5}$
    <li> $1 ≤ X_i ≤ 10^{9}, X_i \neq X_j$ for $i \neq j$
    <li> $1 ≤ Y_i ≤ 10^{5}$
    <li> Sum of $N$ over all testcases does not exceed $10^{5}$

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<b>Example Case 1:</b> Only one player P1. No way to split into teams.<br>
<b>Example Case 2:</b> 3 players total, P1, P2 & P3 with skill level 1, 3 & 6 respectively. Possible divisions:
<ul>
<li> A=[P1], B=[P2, P3]
<li> A=[P1, P2], B=[P3]
</ul>
<b>Example Case 3:</b> 4 players total, P1, P2, P3 & P4 with skill levels 1, 3, 3 & 6 respectively. Possible divisions :
<ul> 
<li> A=[P1], B=[P2, P3, P4]
<li> A=[P1, P2], B=[P3, P4]
<li> A=[P1, P3], B=[P2, P4]
<li> A=[P1, P2, P3], B=[P4]
