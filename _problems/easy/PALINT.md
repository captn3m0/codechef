### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/bengali/PALINT.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/mandarin/PALINT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/russian/PALINT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/vietnamese/PALINT.pdf) as well.

You are given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers and an integer $X$. Your goal is to have as many equal integers as possible in the array. To achieve this goal, you can do the following operation:
- Choose an index $i$ $(1 \leq i \leq N)$  and set $A_i = A_i \oplus X$,  where $\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise xor operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Find the maximum number of equal integers you can have in the final array and the minimum number of operations to obtain these many equal integers.
