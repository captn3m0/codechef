<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>Guardians of the Galaxy were reinstated under Rocket after Thanos killed all the rest. They have set on a new space mission, where they have to destroy $2$ galaxies ruled by Discordiana and Hypnotos (siblings of Thanos).The galaxies initially have $D$ and $H$ number of planets. You are now a guardian and Rocket has ordered you to destroy all the planets in both of the evil galaxies, but he allows you only two guns-       
 - one destroys exactly one planet from both the galaxies simultaneously (can be done only if possible)
- the other cuts in half each planet from one galaxy of your choice and in effect doubles the number of planets. 

You have to find whether itâ€™s possible to destroy both the galaxies, and if yes, the minimum number of gun firings required. 

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $D, H$.

###Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the minimum number of gun firings required. Print $-1$ if not possible. 

###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 50$
- $0 \leq D, H \leq 10^5$

###Sample Input:
2       
2 9     
13 14

###Sample Output:
12   
15
    
###EXPLANATION:
The following sequence of pair of $(D,H)$ will give:-        
(2,9)->(1,8)->(2,8)->(4,8)->(8,8)->(7,7)->(6,6)->(5,5)->(4,4)->(3,3)->(2,2)->(1,1)->(0,0)
