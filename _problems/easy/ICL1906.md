All submissions for this problem are available.Guardians of the Galaxy were reinstated under Rocket after Thanos killed all the rest. They have set on a new space mission, where they have to destroy $2$ galaxies ruled by Discordiana and Hypnotos (siblings of Thanos).The galaxies initially have $D$ and $H$ number of planets. You are now a guardian and Rocket has ordered you to destroy all the planets in both of the evil galaxies, but he allows you only two guns- - one destroys exactly one planet from both the galaxies simultaneously (can be done only if possible) - the other cuts in half each planet from one galaxy of your choice and in effect doubles the number of planets. You have to find whether itâ€™s possible to destroy both the galaxies, and if yes, the minimum number of gun firings required. ###Input: - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $D, H$. ###Output: For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the minimum number of gun firings required. Print $-1$ if not possible. ###Constraints - $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$ - $0 \\leq D, H \\leq 10^5$ ###Sample Input: 2 2 9 13 14 ###Sample Output: 12 15 ###EXPLANATION: The following sequence of pair of $(D,H)$ will give:- (2,9)-&gt;(1,8)-&gt;(2,8)-&gt;(4,8)-&gt;(8,8)-&gt;(7,7)-&gt;(6,6)-&gt;(5,5)-&gt;(4,4)-&gt;(3,3)-&gt;(2,2)-&gt;(1,1)-&gt;(0,0)
