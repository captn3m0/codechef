This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"**This is an interactive task** \n\nLet's clear things up with some definitions:\n- Two binary strings $S$ and $T$ are *anagrams* of each other if it is possible to rearrange the letters in the string $S$ to get a string equal to $T$. \n- Let $S[l,r]$ be the substring of $S$ starting at $l$ and ending at $r$ both inclusive.\n- Let $f(S,l,r)$ be the frequency of character `1` in $S[l,r]$.\n\nChef has two hidden binary strings $A$ and $B$ both of which are of size $N$. It is known that $A$ and $B$ are **not** anagrams. \n\nYou can make queries on the two strings. Each query is of the form:\n\n`? l r`\n\nThe judge will reply with the value of $|f(A,l,r)-f(B,l,r)|$\n \nYou have to find any such index $i$ such that both conditions are fulfilled:\n- $A[1,i-1]$ and $B[1,i-1]$ are anagrams. \n- $A[i+1,N]$ and $B[i+1,N]$ are anagrams.\n\nIf there is no such index then print `-1`.\n\nYou can make atmost $35$ queries per test case.\n\n**Note**: $i$ can be $1$ or $N$ as well. We consider all of $A[1,0],B[1,0],A[N+1,N],B[N+1,N]$ to be empty strings.\n\n### Interaction\n- Begin the interaction by reading a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.\n- Then for each test case read a single integer $N$ denoting the size of $A$ and $B$.\n- To ask a query, output ``? i j`` ($1 \\le i \\le j \\le N$) and then read a single integer.   \n- To print the answer, output ``! `` then print the index.\n- If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n- Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 1000$\n- $A$ and $B$ are **not** anagrams of each other\n\n### Sample Interaction\n\n```\nGrader                You\n3\n4\n                      ? 1 3\n1\n                      ? 2 4\n0\n                      ! 3\n3          \n                      ? 1 1\n1\n                      ? 2 3\n2\n                      ! -1\n3\n                      ? 1 2\n2\n                      ? 1 3\n1\n                      ! 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Test case $1$:** $A = 0101$, $B = 1011$\n    - The query `? 1 3` gives $|1-2| = 1$\n    - The query `? 2 4` gives $|2-2| = 0$\n    - We can see that \n        - $A[1,2]$ and $B[1,2]$ are anagrams.\n        - $A[4,4]$ and $B[4,4]$ are anagrams.\n        - Therefore $3$ is a valid answer.\n\n- **Test case $2$:** $A = 111$, $B = 000$\n    - The query `? 1 1` gives $|1-0| = 1$\n    - The query `? 2 3` gives $|2-0| = 2$\n    - There is no index satisfying the conditions, so we print $-1$.\n\n- **Test case $3$:** $A = 110$, $B = 001$\n    - The query `? 1 2` gives $|2-0| = 2$\n    - The query `? 1 3` gives $|2-1| = 1$\n    - We can see that \n        - $A[1,0]$ and $B[1,0]$ are anagrams (both are empty strings).\n        - $A[2,3]$ and $B[2,3]$ are anagrams.\n        - Therefore $1$ is a valid answer.\n\n\n**Note**: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer. \n","inputFormat":"","inputFormatState":false,"outputFormat":"","outputFormatState":false,"sampleTestCases":[]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/FYDXa9YzDdU","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"utkarsh_25dec","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>utkarsh_25dec<\/span>","problem_tester":"aryanc403","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>aryanc403<\/span>","date_added":"13-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook136'>cook136<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/utkarsh_25dec'>utkarsh_25dec<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/ANGSPLIT","time":{"view_start_date":1639933200,"submit_start_date":1639933200,"visible_start_date":1639933200,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797765},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=ANGSPLIT","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
