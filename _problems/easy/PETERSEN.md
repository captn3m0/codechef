All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK52/mandarin/PETERSEN.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK52/russian/PETERSEN.pdf) as well.

 The following graph **G** is called a [Petersen graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph) and its vertices have been numbered from 0 to **9**. Some letters have also been assigned to vertices of **G**, as can be seen from the following picture:

 ![](//www.codechef.com//download/Petersen1tinysvg.png)

 Let's consider a walk **W** in graph **G**, which consists of **L** vertices **W1**, **W2**, ..., **WL**, such that **Wi** is connected with **Wi + 1** for 1 ≤ **i** &lt; **L**. A string **S** of **L** letters **'A'-'E'** is realized by walk **W** if the sequence of letters written along **W** is equal to **S**. Vertices can be visited multiple times while walking along **W**.

For example, **S** = **'ABBECCD'** is realized by **W** = (0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3).

Your task is to determine whether there is a walk **W** which realizes a given string **S** in graph **G**, and if so, find the lexicographically least such walk.

### Input

 The first line of the input contains one integer **T** denoting the number of testcases to process.

 The only line of each testcase contains one string **S**. It is guaranteed that **S** only consists of symbols **'A'-'E'**.

### Output

 The output should contain exactly **T** lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. For each testcase, if there is no walk **W** which realizes **S**, then output **-1**. Otherwise, you should output the least lexicographical walk **W** which realizes **S**. Since all of the vertices are numbered from 0 to **9**, then it can be encoded as a string consisting of symbols **'0'-'9'** (see the "Examples" section for more details).

### Constraints

1 ≤ **T** ≤ 8;

1 ≤ **|S|** ≤ 100000(105).
