Chandler wants to give Joey money as Joey is going through some financial struggles. He believes 1500 dollars will be enough to pay off the bills. Chandler makes up a game on the spot called "Cups", which has no rules. Every move Joey makes in the "game", Chandler says that he wins a lot of money. Joey, being "smart", finds this out and thus wants to set some rules. 

They have a set of $10^6$ cards, where the $i_{th}$ card ($i>0$) has the number $i$ printed on it. The *value* of a card is defined as the product of all the digits printed on that card. 
For each round, both players throw one card each. The card with higher value wins. If both cards have the same value, the game results in a draw and no one wins the money. 
Joey throws a card first. Find the total number of ways in which Chandler can throw a card leading Joey to win that round.

### Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $n$, denoting the number on Joey's card.

### Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the total number of ways in which Chandler can throw a card leading Joey to win that round.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$

### Sample Input:
	2
	2021
	123456

### Sample Output:
	0
	492829
