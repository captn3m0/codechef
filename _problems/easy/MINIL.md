### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/hindi/MINIL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/mandarin/MINIL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/russian/MINIL.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/vietnamese/MINIL.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK126/bengali/MINIL.pdf) as well.

You are given a grid with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$). Each cell of this grid contains either water or land. The initial state of the grid is described by strings $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$; for each valid $i$ and $j$, the $j$-th character of $S_i$ is '.' if the cell in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column initially contains water or '*' if this cell initially contains land.

A maximal group of connected land cells (by moving between side-adjacent land cells) is called an *island*.

You may perform any number of operations (including zero). In one operation, you should choose one cell of the grid and convert it either to a land cell or to a water cell. Find the smallest number of operations required to maximise the number of islands in the grid.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string $S_i$ with length $M$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest number of operations required to maximise the number of islands.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $2 \le N, M \le 10$
- $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$ contain only characters '.' and '*' 

### Example Input
```
2
2 2
..
*.
2 4
*..*
*.*.
```

### Example Output
```
1
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The largest number of islands is $2$ and it can be achieved by converting one cell from water to land. The resulting grid is

```
.*
*.
