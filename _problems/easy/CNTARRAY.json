This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq B_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $B_i \\neq B_j$ for all $1 \\le i \\lt j \\le N$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask $1$ (30 points)**: $1 \\leq R \\leq 10\\,000$\n- **Subtask $2$ (70 points)**: $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You love array, don't you?\n\nYou are given two integer $N$ and $M$, along with an array $B$ of length $N$ containing **pairwise distinct** integers.
