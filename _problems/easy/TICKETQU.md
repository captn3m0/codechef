### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/russian/TICKETQU.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/mandarin/TICKETQU.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/bengali/TICKETQU.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/vietnamese/TICKETQU.pdf) as well.

There are $N$ people, numbered from $1$ to $N$. They go to a cinema hall. Each of them buys a ticket, which has a number written on it. The number on the ticket of the $i^{th}$ person is $A_i$. 

There are infinite seats in the cinema hall. The seats are numbered sequentially starting from $1$. All the $N$ people stand in a queue to get their respective seats. Person $1$ stands at the front of the queue, Person $2$ stands in the second position of the queue, so on up to Person $N$ who stands at the rear of the queue. They were given seats in this manner:


Let the number on the ticket of the person currently standing in front of the queue be $X$. If the $X^{th}$ seat is empty, the person gets out of the queue and takes the $X^{th}$ seat. Otherwise the person goes to the rear of the queue, and the number on his ticket is incremented by one - that is, it becomes $X+1$.

Print the seat number occupied by each of the $N$ people.
