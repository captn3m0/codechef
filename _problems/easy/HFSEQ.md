### Read problems statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/russian/HFSEQ.pdf).

Chef has an array $A$ of size $N$. Chef wants to choose any subsequence of size **exactly** $ \lceil \frac{N}{2} \rceil$ from the array such that GCD of all the elements in that sequence must be $2$. Chef names such a kind of sequence as a *half-sequence*.   

Help Chef to find whether he would be able to select any half-sequence in the given array.

As a reminder,
- A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the given array by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.   
- GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The greatest common divisor of a subsequence is the largest integer $d$ such that all the numbers in sequence are divisible by $d$. For more information, refer to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
- $ \lceil x \rceil $ is the ceiling (round up) operation: $ \lceil 3.5 \rceil = 4 ,\lceil 2 \rceil = 2 $.
