This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1\\le N \\le 200\\,000$\n- $1\\le S_i\\le 200\\,000$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/mandarin\/SLIPPERS.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/vietnamese\/SLIPPERS.pdf), and [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/russian\/SLIPPERS.pdf) as well.\n\nMiana and Serdenopis have guests for dinner tonight and thus they have prepared $N$ pairs of slippers for their guests (who shall take off their shoes before entering the house).\nThe slippers are on a line and the $i$-th pair of slippers has size $S_i$.\n\nWhen a guest enters, he takes the first pair of slippers which are still in the line (i.e., they are not taken by a previous guest) and are big enough for him (that is, the slippers' size must be larger or equal than his shoes' size) and does not touch any other pair of slippers.
