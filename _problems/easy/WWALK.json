The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\r\n- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the total weird distance.
