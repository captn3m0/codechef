Some cities have a train and each city has at most one train originating from it. The trains are represented by an array $A$, where $A_i = 0$ means the $i$-th city doesn't have any train originating from it, $A_i = 1$ means the train originating from the $i$-th city is moving right (to a higher numbered city), and $A_i = 2$ means the train originating from the $i$-th city is moving left (to a lower numbered city).\r\n\r\nEach train keeps on going forever in its direction and takes $1$ minute to travel from the current station to the next one. There is a special station at city $1$ which lets travellers instantaneously teleport to any other station that currently has a train. Teleportation and getting on a train once in the city both take $0$ minutes and all trains start at time $0$.\r\n\r\nThere are $M$ travellers at city $1$, and the $i$-th traveller has destination city $B_i$. They ask Chef to guide them to teleport to a particular station from which they can catch a train to go to their destination in the least time possible.
