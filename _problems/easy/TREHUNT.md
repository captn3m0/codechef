Chef lives in an $N \times M$ grid. He is currently participating in a treasure hunt, and has two items left to find. Chef knows that the Manhattan distance between the cells containing these two items is exactly $k$. He wants to know, in how many different pairs of cells can the two items be present? 

Let $A_k$ be the number of desired pairs when the value of Manhattan distance between the two cells containing these two items is equal to $k$. Let $C = \sum_{i=1}^{N + M - 2} A_i \cdot 31^{i-1}$. You have to find the value of $C$.

The answer may be large, so you need to find it modulo $998244353$.

The Manhattan distance between two points $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$ is defined as $|x - x'| + |y - y'|$.
