This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i, K \\leq 10^9$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You are given an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N]$ consisting of $N$ positive integers.\n\nYou are also given a constant $K$, using which you can perform the following operation on $A$:\n- Choose two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $A_i + A_j \\le K$, and remove either $A_i$ or $A_j$ from $A$.\n\nIs it possible to obtain an array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such operations?","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
