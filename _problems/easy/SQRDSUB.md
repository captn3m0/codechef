### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/hindi/SQRDSUB.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/bengali/SQRDSUB.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/mandarin/SQRDSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/russian/SQRDSUB.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL20/vietnamese/SQRDSUB.pdf) as well.

Let's call a sequence of integers *good* if the product of its elements can be represented as a difference of squares of two integers. More formally, a sequence $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_K$ is *good* if it is possible to find two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $S_1 \cdot S_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot S_K = p^2 - q^2$.

Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. He wants to find the number of contiguous subsequences of $A$ which are good. Can you help him?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of good contiguous subsequences of $A$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^3$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $|A_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $N \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
2 5 6
```

### Example Output
```
2
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** For the subsequences $[1]$ and $[3]$, their products can be represented as differences of two squared integers: $1 = 1^2-0^2$ and $3 = 2^2-1^2$ respectively.
 
**Example case 2:** The two good subsequences are $[5]$ and $[2,5,6]$. Their products can be represented as differences of two squared integers: $5 = 3^2-2^2$ and $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 60 = 8^2-2^2$ respectively.
