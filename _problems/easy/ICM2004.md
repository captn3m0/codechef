You are given a string $S$ of length $N$ consisting only of A's and B's.
You will be given $Q$ queries each of which can be either of Type 1 or Type 2.
- For a query of Type 1, you will be given two numbers $L$ and $R$ and a character $C$. You are supposed to replace every character in $S$ from position $L$ to $R$ with $C$.
- For a query of Type 2, you will be given 4 numbers $L$, $R$, $p$ and $q$. Now, for every character in $S$ from position $L$ to $R$, perform the following operations in the order left to right:
    - If the character is "A", then replace $p$ with $(p - q+MOD)\%MOD$ and $q$ with $(p+q)\%MOD$.
    - If the character is "B", then replace $p$ with $(p+q)\%MOD$ and $q$ with $(q-p+MOD)\%MOD$.

$MOD$ is $10^9+7$.

Your task is to print the final values of $p$ and $q$ for each query of Type 2.
###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains multiple lines of input.
- The first line of a testcase contains the integer $N$
- The second line containes the string $S$
- The third line contains the number of queries for that testcase, $Q$
- The next $Q$ lines contain the actual queries. 
    - For Type 1 query, the input would be $1$ $L$ $R$ $C$
    - For Type 2 query, the input would be $2$ $L$ $R$ $p$ $q$

###Output:
For each testcase, for each query of type 2, output in separate lines the value of $p$ followed by $q$.
###Constraints 
- $1 \leq T \leq 5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 10^4$
- $0 \leq p,q \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq L,R \leq N$
- $C \in {A,B}$
- The sum of $N$ over all testcases is less than equal to $10^5$ and sum of $Q$ over all testcases is less than equal to $10^4$

###Sample Input:
	1
	2
	AA
	3
	1 2 2 B
	2 1 1 1 1
	2 1 2 1 2

###Sample Output:
	0 2
	2 4
