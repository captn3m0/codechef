By permutation we mean a rearrangment of the\nnumber 1,...,<em>N<\/em>.  For example<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8\n<\/pre>\n\n<p> is a permutation of 1,2,...,8.  Of course,<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n<\/pre>\n\n<p> is also a permutation of 1,2,...,8.<\/p>\n\n<p> We can \"walk around\" a permutation in a interesting way and here\nis how it is done for the permutation above:<\/p>\n\n<p> Start at position 1. At position 1 we have 2 and so we go to\nposition 2.  Here we find 4 and so we go to position 4.  Here we find\n1, which is a position that we have already visited. This completes\nthe first part of our walk and we denote this walk by (1 2 4 1). Such\na walk is called a <em>cycle<\/em>.  An interesting property of such\nwalks, that you may take for granted, is that the position we revisit\nwill always be the one we started from! <\/p>\n\n<p> We continue our walk by jumping to first unvisited position, in\nthis case position 3 and continue in the same manner. This time we\nfind 5 at position 3 and so we go to position 5 and find 7 and we go\nto position 7 and find 3 and thus we get the cycle (3 5 7 3).  Next we\nstart at position 6 and get (6 6) and finally we start at position 8\nand get the cycle (8 8). We have exhausted all the positions.  Our\nwalk through this permutation consists of 4 cycles.<\/p>\n\n<p> One can carry out this walk through any permutation and obtain a\nset of cycles as the result.  Your task is to print out the cycles\nthat result from walking through a given permutation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Input format<\/p>\n\n<p> The first line of the input is a positive integer <em>N<\/em>\nindicating the length of the permutation. The next line contains\n<em>N<\/em> integers and is a permutation of 1,2,...,<em>N<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p> You may assume that <em>N<\/em>     1000.<\/p>\n\n<p>Output format<\/p>\n\n<p> The first line of the output must contain a single integer\n<em>k<\/em> denoting the number of cycles in the permutation.  Line 2\nshould describe the first cycle, line 3 the second cycle and so on and\nline <em>k<\/em>+1 should describe the kth cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples<\/p>\n\n<p>Sample input 1:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n8\n2 4 5 1 7 6 3 8\n<\/pre>\n\n\n<p>Sample output 1:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n4\n1 2 4 1\n3 5 7 3\n6 6\n8 8 \n<\/pre>\n\n<p>Sample input 2:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>Sample output 2:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\n8\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n5 5\n6 6\n7 7\n8 8\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"PCYCLE","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"PCYCLE"}
