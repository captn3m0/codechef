This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 20$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 40$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 40$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$, both of length $N$.\n\nYou would like to choose **exactly** $K$ **distinct** indices $i_1,i_2, \\ldots, i_K$ such that $\\min(A_{i_1}+A_{i_2}+ \\ldots + A_{i_K}, B_{i_1}+B_{i_2}+\\ldots + B_{i_K})$ is **maximized**.
