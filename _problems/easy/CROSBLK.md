### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/CROSBLK.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/bengali/CROSBLK.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/CROSBLK.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/CROSBLK.pdf) as well.

Chef is very adventurous, so he asked Bob to give him a task.

Bob gave him a sequence of blocks with heights $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Chef is at the first block and he has to reach the $N$-th block using the minimum number of moves to complete the task.

In one move, he can jump from the $i$-th block to the $j$-th block only if the following conditions are satisfied:
- $i \lt j$
- $A_i \geq A_j$
- for all $k$ ($i \lt k \lt j$), $A_k \leq A_j$

You have to find the minimum number of moves Chef needs to perform to reach the last block, or determine that it is impossible.
