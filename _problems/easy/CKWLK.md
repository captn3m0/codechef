You are playing EVE Online. Initially, you have one dollar, but you have somehow acquired two cheat codes. The first cheat code multiplies the amount of money you own by $10$, while the second one multiplies it by $20$. The cheat codes can be used any number of times.

You want to have exactly $N$ dollars. Now you are wondering: can you achieve that by only using some sequence of cheat codes?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
- For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"Yes"` if you can make exactly $N$ dollars or `"No"` otherwise.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

### Example Input
```
4
200
90
1000000000000
1024000000000
```

### Example Output
