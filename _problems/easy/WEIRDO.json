Each recipe is represented by a string containing only lowercase English letters. Let's denote Alice's recipes by $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ and Bob's recipes by $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_M$.\r\n\r\nAccidentally, Chef mixed up those recipes \u2015 now, he has $L = N+M$ recipes in a sequence $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_L$. Thankfully, the recipes created by Alice and Bob are distinguishable from each other. It is well-known that for each recipe $s$ created by Alice, the following property holds, and for each recipe created by Bob, it does not hold: For each $1 \\le l \\lt r \\le |s|$, the substring $s_l, s_{l+1}, \\ldots, s_r$ contains at least as many vowels as consonants. The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels, while the other letters are consonants.\r\n\r\nThe score of a candidate who made $K$ recipes is calculated as the product of $\\frac{x_c}{fx_c^K}$ for all letters $c$ that occur in at least one of these recipes; here, $x_c$ is the number of recipes which contain the letter $c$ and $fx_c$ is the total number of occurrences of this letter in all $K$ recipes.\r\n\r\nLet's denote the scores of Alice and Bob by $sc_A$ and $sc_B$ respectively. Chef wants to know their ratio $sc_A\/sc_B$. We know that Chef is a legendary cook, but he is not very good at calculating, so he is asking you to find that number.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $L$.\r\n- $L$ lines follow.
