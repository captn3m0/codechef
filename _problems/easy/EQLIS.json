This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- The sum of $N$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"For a permutation $P$ of length $N$, we define $L(P)$ to be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in $P$.

You need to output a permutation $P$ of length $N$ such that $L(P) = L(P^R)$, or say that none exist.\n\n**Note:** $P$ is said to be a permutation of length $N$ if $P$ is a sequence of length $N$ consisting of $N$ **distinct** integers between $1$ and $N$. For example, $(3, 1, 2)$ is a permutation of length $3$, but $(1, 4, 2)$, $(2, 2, 3)$ and $(2, 1)$ are not.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
