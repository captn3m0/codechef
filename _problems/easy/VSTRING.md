### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/bengali/VSTRING.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/mandarin/VSTRING.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/russian/VSTRING.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/vietnamese/VSTRING.pdf) as well.

Given a binary string $S$ consisting of $0's$ and $1's$, find whether there exists a rightwise  [circular rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift) of the string such that every 2 adjacent $1's$ are separated by at most $C$ $0's$.

**Note:** The last occurrence of $1$ in the rotated string won't have any $1$ next to it, i.e, first and the last ones in the string are not considered to be adjacent.

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of two lines of input.
- First line contains two space separated integers $N, C$, length of the string and the upper limit on a number of $0's$ between $2$ adjacent $1's$.
-  Second line contains the binary string $S$.

###Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "YES" if there exists a rightwise circular rotation of string satisfying the criteria and "NO" if it doesn't exist.

**Note:** The output is case-insensitive â€• each letter may be printed in upper case or lower case.

###Constraints 
- $1 \leq N \leq 5*10^5$
- $0 \leq C \leq max(0, N - 2)$
- Sum of $N$ over all tests is atmost $10^6$.

###Sample Input:
```
3
4 1
1100
4 0
0101
6 1
101001
```

###Sample Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```
	
###Explanation:
**Case 1:** In the original configuration maximum number of $0's$ between $2$ adjacent $1's$ is $0$, therefore it satisfies the criteria.

**Case 2:** The $4$ circular rotations of the string S = {"0101", "1010", "0101", "1010"}. In all the cases the maximum number of $0's$ between $2$ consecutive $1's$ is $1$ which doesn't satisfies the criteria.

**Case 3:** The $6$ circular rotations of the string S = {"101001", "110100", "011010", "001101", "100110", "010011"} out of which $second$, $third$ and $fourth$ strings satisfy the criteria.
