This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- It is guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (100 points):** Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/MAKEPAL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/MAKEPAL.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/MAKEPAL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/MAKEPAL.pdf) as well.\n\nNaveej is from a tribe that speaks some weird language - their alphabet consists of $N$ distinct characters.\nHe has an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N]$, where $A_i$ denotes the number of occurrences of the $i$-th character with him. \n\nHe wants to make a [palindromic string](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Palindrome) using **all** the characters he has (every character he has must be used in this string).\n\nIn order to make this possible, he can perform the following operation:\n- Select an $i$ $(1 \\le i \\le N)$ and convert all occurrences of $i$-th alphabet to any other alphabet of his choice.\n\nNote that Naveej just wants to be able to make any palindrome, as long as every character is used. For example, if $N = 2$ and $A = [2, 2]$ and we consider the characters to be $a$ and $b$, he can make both $abba$ and $baab$, but $aba$ is not allowed because it uses only $3$ characters.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required such that Naveej can make a palindromic string using all the characters he has. It can be proven that there always exists at least one sequence of operations allowing for the formation of a palindrome.\n","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
