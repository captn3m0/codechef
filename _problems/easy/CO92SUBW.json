Chefcity can be represented as a straight line with Chef's house at point 0 on this line. There is an infinite number of subway stations in Chefcity, numbered by positive integers. The first station is located at point 1 and for each <b>i<\/b> \u2265 1, the distance between stations <b>i<\/b> and <b>i+1<\/b> is equal to <b>i+1<\/b>. (Station <b>i+1<\/b> is always located at a higher coordinate than station <b>i<\/b>, i.e., the subway stations are located at points 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 etc.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Subway trains in Chefcity allow Chef to move between any pair of adjacent stations in one minute, regardless of the distance between them. Chef can also move by walking; his walking speed is one unit of distance in one minute. Chef can enter or exit the subway at any station.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chef has decided to go to the cinema. The only cinema in Chefcity is located at point <b>X<\/b>. (Note that the cinema can be placed at the same point as a subway station.) Help Chef determine the minimum possible time required to get to the cinema from his house.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
