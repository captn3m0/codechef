### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/hindi/SKMP.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/bengali/SKMP.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/mandarin/SKMP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/russian/SKMP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG20/vietnamese/SKMP.pdf) as well.

Chef has a string $S$. He also has another string $P$, called *pattern*. He wants to find the pattern in $S$, but that might be impossible. Therefore, he is willing to reorder the characters of $S$ in such a way that $P$ occurs in the resulting string (an anagram of $S$) as a substring.

Since this problem was too hard for Chef, he decided to ask you, his genius friend, for help. Can you find the lexicographically smallest anagram of $S$ that contains $P$ as substring?

Note: A string $B$ is a substring of a string $A$ if $B$ can be obtained from $A$ by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $S$.
- The second line contains a single string $P$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string â€• the smallest anagram of $S$ that contains $P$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le |P| \le |S| \le 10^5$
- $S$ and $P$ contain only lowercase English letters
- there is at least one anagram of $S$ that contains $P$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $|S| \le 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** $|S| \le 10^5$
