All submissions for this problem are available.Chef talks a lot on his mobile phone. As a result he exhausts his talk-value (in Rokdas) very quickly. One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said "Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5\*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month’s usage.

There are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. **Note** - If a plan is valid for **M** months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every **M** months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.

### Input

First line contains **T**- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains **D**- the default rate (Rokdas/minute, real number), **U**- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and **N**- the number of add-on plans available. Then **N** lines follow, each containing **M**- the number of months the plan is valid for, **R**- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas/minute, real number) and **C**- the cost of the plan.

### Output

For each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.

### Constraints

1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100
0.5 ≤ **D** ≤ 10.0 (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)
1 ≤ **U** ≤ 10000
1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100
1 ≤ **M** ≤ 36
0.05 ≤ **R** &lt; **D** (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)
1 ≤ **C** ≤ 1000

### Explanation

**Test Case 1:** This test case is same as the example in the problem statement.
**Test Case 2:** This is for you to work out!
**Test Case 3:** Chef's monthly usage is only 50 Rokdas and none of the 2 plans are advantageous, hence the answer is zero '0'.
**Test Case 4:** Again solve it yourself, but NOTE - if Chef had chosen plan 1, he would have to pay 10 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 3 months and NOT every month. Similarly had he chosen plan 2, he would have to pay 20 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 2 months.
