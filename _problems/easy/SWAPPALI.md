### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME81/hindi/SWAPPALI.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME81/bengali/SWAPPALI.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME81/mandarin/SWAPPALI.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME81/russian/SWAPPALI.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME81/vietnamese/SWAPPALI.pdf) as well.

You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of $S$ (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.

Find the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string $S$ into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If it is impossible to make the string $S$ a palindrome, print a single line containing the string `"NO"` (without quotes).
- Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string `"YES"` (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer â€• the minimum required number of operations.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $N \le 10^3$
- $S$ contains only characters 'a' and 'b'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
4
abab
5
acbba
5
aaaab
```

### Example Output
```
YES
1
YES
1
NO
```
