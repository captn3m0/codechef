This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq N$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test caes does not exceed $5\\cdot 10^5$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (100 points):** Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/mandarin\/FIXPTS.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/russian\/FIXPTS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/vietnamese\/FIXPTS.pdf) as well.\n\nAn index of an array is called a fixed point if the value on the index of the array is equal to the index itself. Formally, an index $i$ of an array $A$ of length $N$ is a fixed point if $A_i = i$, where $1\\leq i \\leq N$.\n\nFor example, in the array $A = [1, 3, 3, 4, 1]$, the indices $1, 3, 4$ are fixed points.\n\n\nChef has an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers. Chef tries to find the number of fixed points over all subarrays of the array $A$. More formally, for every pair $(L, R)$ such that $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$, Chef considers the subarray $A_L, A_{L+1}, \\dots, A_R$ and calculates the total number of fixed points in all such subarrays. However, Chef finds this task very hard. Can you help him find the number of fixed points over all subarrays?","inputFormat":"- The first line contains $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
