Chef is trying to invent the light bulb that can run at room temperature without electricity. So he has $N$ gases numbered from $0$ to $N - 1$ that he can use and he doesn't know which one of the $N$ gases will work but we do know it.

Now Chef has worked on multiple search algorithms to optimize search. For this project, he uses a modulo-based search algorithm that he invented himself. So first he chooses an integer $K$ and selects all indices $i$ in increasing order such that $i \bmod K = 0$ and test the gases on such indices, then all indices $i$ in increasing order such that $i \bmod K = 1$, and test the gases on such indices, and so on.


Given $N$, the index of the gas $p$ that will work, and $K$, find after how much time will he be able to give Chefland a new invention assuming that testing $1$ gas takes $1$ day.


For example, consider $N = 5, p = 2$ and $K = 3$.
- On the $1^{st}$ day, Chef tests gas numbered $0$ because $0 \bmod 3 = 0$.
- On the $2^{nd}$ day, Chef tests gas numbered $3$ because $3 \bmod 3 = 0$.
- On the $3^{rd}$ day, Chef tests gas numbered $1$ because $1 \bmod 3 = 1$.
- On the $4^{th}$ day, Chef tests gas numbered $4$ because $4 \bmod 3 = 1$.
- On the $5^{th}$ day, Chef tests gas numbered $2$ because $2 \bmod 3 = 2$.

So after $5$ days, Chef will be able to give Chefland a new invention
