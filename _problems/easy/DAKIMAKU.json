That's right, a dakimakura for every resident of Berland!\n\nIt is known that Berland consists of $N$ cities, where $C_i$ people live in city $i$ and it takes $T_i$ hours to get from city $i$ to city $i + 1$.\n\nThe government is ready to allocate $x$ tugriks for the implementation of the project to give out dakimakuras. They also agreed with local producers, so the dakimakuras themselves are free.\n\nTo implement the project, the government can open a branch for issuing dakimakuras free of charge in several cities. For each city with an open branch for issuing dakimakuras, the government can pay $1$ tugrik to increase its productivity by $1$ unit. It can be increased any number of times, so that a productivity of $k$ units costs $k$ tugriks.\n\nThen the issuance of dakimakuras begins. For each resident of the country that is located in city $i$, he\/she will travel to the first city with index greater or equal to $i$ that has a branch. Recall, it takes $T_i$ hours to travel from city $i$ to $i+1$. After arrival, he\/she enters the queue in the branch.\n\nFor each branch, it handles the queue as follows.\n\n- Let the productivity of this branch be $p$. If there are less than $p$ people in the queue, then the branch issues dakimakuras to everyone in the queue. Otherwise, it starts with the first $p$ people, and gives them dakimakuras. A branch can only give dakimakuras every hour (that is, integer times since the start). Also, a resident cannot receive a dakimakura at the same moment he\/she enters the queue.\n\nYou must find the minimum amount of time required for the government to issue dakimakuras to all residents of Berland, spending no more than $x$ tugriks in total. Assume all the residents start travelling at the same time, and the branches also opened at hour $0$.\n\n### Input\n\n- The first line contains a single integer $t$ - the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n- The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $x$ - the number of cities in Berland and the maximum amount of tugriks that the government can spend.\n- The second line contains $N$ integers $C_1, \\ldots, C_n$.\n- The third line contains $N - 1$ integers $T_1, \\ldots, T_{n-1}$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print in a single line the answer to the problem.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\leq t \\leq 5$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$\n- $0 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq T_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n### Subtasks\n- **Subtask 1 (20 points):** $2 \\leq N \\leq 8$, $1 \\leq x, T_i \\leq 8$ and $0 \\leq C_i \\leq 8$\n- **Subtask 2 (20 points):** $x = 1$\n- **Subtask 3 (40 points):** $2 \\leq N \\leq 40$\n- **Subtask 4 (20 points):** Original constraints\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n2\n5 6\n8 3 1 5 0\n1 1 1 1\n5 1\n2 8 0 0 1\n7 3 1 2\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n3\n16\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe first test case:\n\nLet's open a branch in city $1$ with productivity $3$ and one in city $4$ with productivity $3$.\n\nThen in the $0$-th hour, $8$ people in city $1$ and $5$ people in city $4$ will enter the queues in their respective cities. Meanwhile, the people in cities $2$ and $3$ will travel to the next city.\n\nThen in the $1$-st hour, $3$ people in city $1$ and $3$ people in city $4$ will receive dakimakuras. Now the numbers of remaining people in each city are $[5,0,3,3,0]$.\n\nThen in the $2$-nd hour, $3$ people in city $1$ and $3$ people in city $4$ will receive dakimakuras. Now the numbers of remaining people in each city are $[2, 0, 0, 3, 0]$.\n\nThen in the $3$-rd hour, $2$ people in city $1$ and $3$ people in city $4$ will receive dakimakuras. Now, every resident in Berland has received a dakimakura, so the process took $3$ hours.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY21\/bengali\/DAKIMAKU.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY21\/mandarin\/DAKIMAKU.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY21\/russian\/DAKIMAKU.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY21\/vietnamese\/DAKIMAKU.pdf) as well.\n\nOnly a few centuries later, the Berland government realized what was necessary for the country's prosperity.
