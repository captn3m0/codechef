Some of the chairs are empty while others have a child sitting in it. You are required to change the places of the children so that all the children sit next to each other (i.e. they form a connected segment). You can do that by doing the following operation a number of times:<\/p>\n\n<p>\nChoose a child and tell him to walk around the circle in clockwise order or anti-clockwise order until he finds the first empty chair, and tell him to sit there.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhat is the minimum number of operations required to make all children sit next to each other?\n<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains <b>T<\/b>, the number of test-cases.<\/p>\n<p>\nThe first line of each test-case contains <b>N<\/b>, the number of chairs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second line of each test-case contains a binary string of length <b>N<\/b>. If the <b>i<\/b>-th character is 1 then the <b>i<\/b>-th chair has a child initially. Otherwise (i.e. the <b>i<\/b>-th character is 0) it's empty.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer donating minimum number of operations needed.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>T<\/b> \u2264 <b>5,000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 sum of <b>N<\/b> in all test-cases \u2264 <b>10<sup>6<\/sup><\/b><\/li>\n<li>at least one chair will be occupied<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n8\n10001010\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>The initial configuration is:\n<pre>       \n                 <b>1<\/b>\n              0    0\n           1          0\n              0    0\n                  1\n<\/pre><\/p>\n<p>We can tell the child who is <b>boldened<\/b> to move counter-clockwise, and the new configuration will be:\n<pre>       \n                 0\n              <b>1<\/b>    0\n           1          0\n              0    0\n                  1\n<\/pre><\/p>\n<p>because he has moved to the first empty chair on his way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, we again tell him to move counter-clockwise, and now the new configuration will be:\n<pre>       \n                 0\n              0    0\n           1          0\n              <b>1<\/b>    0\n                  1\n<\/pre><\/p>\n<p>because he moved counter-clockwise, found an occupied chair, and hence kept moving.
