However, since Grux was just playing with the permutation, it was all shuffled, and Chef only likes sorted permutations, so he decided to sort it by performing some swaps.\n\nChef wants to use the integer $D$ he just received, so he is only willing to swap two elements of the permutation whenever their absolute difference is exactly $D$. He has limited time, so you should determine the minimum number of swaps he needs to perform to sort the permutation, or tell him that it is impossible to sort it his way.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
