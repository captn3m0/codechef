This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq U, V \\leq N$\n- $U \\neq V$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $A$ is strictly increasing\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases is not more than $5 \\cdot 10^5$\n- Sum of $M$ over all test cases is not more than $4 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"There is a [tree](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tree_(data_structure)) with $N$ nodes numbered from $1$ to  $N$ outside Harshikaa's house.

Suddenly it started raining, and every second a drop falls on all the leaf nodes of the tree. Also, every second any drop which wasn't already on the root node moves one node closer to the root.\n\nSometimes, strong winds shake the tree and **all drops which were not on the root** fall off. It is known that the wind will shake the tree $M$ times at $A_1, A_2, \\ldots A_M$ seconds after it started raining. \n\nIf multiple events happen at the same second, they are in this order:\n- Raindrops move one node closer to the root.\n- New raindrops fall on the leaves.\n- Wind shakes the tree.\n\nHow many drops are there at the root **right after** the $M$-th shake?","inputFormat":"- The first line of each input contains $T$ - the number of test cases.
