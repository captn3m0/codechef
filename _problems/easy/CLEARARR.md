### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/CLEARARR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/CLEARARR.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/CLEARARR.pdf) as well.

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ elements. You can do the following operations on that array:

- Remove the leftmost element of the array, with index $l$, for the cost $A_l$. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least $1$ element).
- Remove the rightmost element of the array, with index $r$, for the cost $A_r$. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least $1$ element).
- Remove both the leftmost and rightmost element, with indexes $l$ and $r$ respectively, for a fixed cost $X$ which is given. This operation can only be done $K$ times and only if the array has at least $2$ elements left.

If the array has only $1$ element left, then the rightmost element is the same as the leftmost element so the first and second operations will have the same cost.

You have to print the minimum cost to *clear the array* (remove all elements using one of the three operations above).

**NOTE: The answer may not fit in 32-bit integers, so please use 64-bit data types in your programming language.**
