The board overviewing the project wants to hire $K$ teams of workers \u2014 one for each task. All teams begin working simultaneously.\r\n\r\nObviously, there must be at least one person in each team. For a team of $A$ workers, it takes exactly $A$ days to complete the task they are hired for. Each team acts independently, unaware of the status of other teams (whether they have completed their tasks or not), and submits their result for approval on the $A$-th day.\r\n\r\nHowever, the board approves the project only if all $K$ teams complete their tasks on the same day \u2014 it rejects everything submitted on any other day.

The one-man team working on task $2$ completes it and submits the result for approval on each day, but it is rejected on the first and second day. On the third day, the team working on task $1$ also completes their task, so the project gets approved after exactly $3$ days.\r\n\r\n**Example case 2:** We can hire a team of $3$ workers for task $1$ and a team of $2$ workers for task $2$.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK124\/hindi\/HIRINGWO.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK124\/mandarin\/HIRINGWO.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK124\/russian\/HIRINGWO.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK124\/vietnamese\/HIRINGWO.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK124\/bengali\/HIRINGWO.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nA manufacturing project consists of exactly $K$ tasks.
