### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/bengali/DIVISOR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/mandarin/DIVISOR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/russian/DIVISOR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START1/vietnamese/DIVISOR.pdf) as well.

Given an integer N, you can apply a operation on $N$ multiple times(possibly 0).        

Operation is defined as follows:    
- Choose a positive integer $K$ such that $K$ has exactly $4$ divisors and $K$ is a divisor of $N$.    
- Change $N$ to $N/K$.         

Find the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number $N$. 

### Input:
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integers $N$.

### Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.

### Constraints 
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$

### Subtasks
- 100 points : original constraints

### Sample Input:
```
5
3
64
30
120
45
```
###Sample Output:
```
2
1
2
1
2
```	
### EXPLANATION:
**Example case 1:** We cannot divide $N=3$ by any valid $K$ and hence output is $2$ as $N=3$ has exactly two divisors $1$ and $3$.  

**Example case 2:** $N=64$ can be divided by $8$ twice as $8$ has exactly $4$ divisors ( $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$ )  and hence the resultant value of $N$ will be $1$ and $1$ has only $1$ divisor hence answer is $1$.   

**Example case 3:** We can divide $N=30$ by $6$, $10$ or $15$ as all three of them have exactly $4$ divisors. In each case resultant value of $N$ will be either $5$, $3$ or $2$. And all three of them has exactly $2$ divisors and they cannot be divided further. Hence the output is $2$.     

**Example case 4:** One of the optimal ways to divide $N=120$ is divide $120$ by $8$ followed by dividing  by $15$. The resultant value will be $120/8 = 15$ and $15/15 = 1$. The number $1$ has exactly one divisor and hence output is $1$.        
Note that, If we divided $N=120$ by $6$ then we won't get the optimal answer.       

**Example case 5:** We can divide $N=45$ by $15$ and resultant value of $N$ will be $3$. The number $3$ has exactly $2$ divisors and hence output is $2$
