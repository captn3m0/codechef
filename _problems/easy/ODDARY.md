### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/ODDARY.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/ODDARY.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/ODDARY.pdf) as well.

Construct an array of length $N$ containing only positive integers in the range $[1, 1000]$ such that there doesnâ€™t exist a subarray that has all elements occurring in even frequency and the maximum element in the array is minimized. In case there are multiple solutions, you can output any.
