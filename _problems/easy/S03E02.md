Ross has to give an important speech at the museum and he wants all of his friends in the first row of the auditorium. Ross is punctual and gets ready on time. However, Joey and Chandler are behaving like children and fighting over everything. On getting a firm shouting from Ross, both of them decide to get dressed but they are still angry at each other. Chandler decides to have the final laugh by stealing Joey’s underwear. This makes Joey mad and he decides to wear all the pants owned by Chandler. Seeing Joey wear all of Chandler’s pants infuriates Ross even more.  

There is a time crunch as Ross is about to give a speech and he wants him to wear pants of a single colour. Joey has time to make at most $k$ moves. In one move, he can:

- Pull out any number of consecutive pants from the top and.
- From the ones pulled out, he can pick any number (possibly 0) of consecutive pants from top and wear them again, leaving the rest on the ground. He cannot use the pants discarded after the move.

Note that Joey can perform both of these actions in only one move.

Find the maximum number of pants of the **same colour** that Joey can wear using at most $k$ moves.


### Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- For each testcase first line of input contains two integers $n, k$, the number of pants and the maximum number of moves.
- Second line of each testcase contains a string containing n characters (Uppercase English letters). $i_{th}$ character from the beginning denotes the colour of the $i_{th}$ layer of pants from top.

### Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum number of pants of the same colour that Joey can wear using atmost k moves.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$

### Sample Input:
	2
	5 2
	ABACA 
	4 1
	ABAB

### Sample Output:
	3
	1

### Explanation
- In the first test case: for the first move, pull out the first 2 pants(AB), leave the bottommost pants(B) and wear the rest(A) again. Now the layers are $AACA$. Similarly for the second move, pull out the first 3 pants(AAC), leave the bottommost pants(C) and wear the rest(AA) again.
Finally Joey is wearing $AAA$, i.e. 3 pants of colour A.
- In the second test case: for the first and only move, pull out all the pants(ABAB), leave the bottommost three pants(BAB) and wear the rest(A) again.
