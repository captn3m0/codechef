This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^{5}$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$\n- $0 \\leq M \\leq min( \\frac{N \\cdot (N-1)}{2},3 \\cdot 10^{5})$\n- $u \\neq v$.\n- All the edges mentioned in the input are unique.\n- The sum of $N$ over all cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^{5}$\n- The sum of $M$ over all cases doesn't exceed $5 \\cdot 10^{5}$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khilji are blood-enemies of each other. Ratan Singh has a diverse and well planned kingdom. His kingdom has $N$ provinces. Every province has a  bidirectional road to every other province (except itself of course). But Alauddin has now attacked his kingdom. During his attack, he destroyed some of the roads connecting provinces.\n\nTo fight back, Ratan Singh divided his sena(army) into two senas. Sena $X$ and Sena $Y$.\nSena $X$ has the best warriors, while Sena $Y$ doesn\u2019t. According to his plan, each province should be protected by exactly one of the two senas( $X$ or $Y$).\n\nAs Sena $X$ is very strong, Ratan Singh will place them in such a way that: \n - **No two adjacent** provinces (provinces connected by a road) are guarded by Sena $X$. \n - If a province $P$ is guarded by Sena $X$, then **all** the provinces which are guarded by Sena $Y$ needs to be adjacent to province $P$. \n - There should exist at least one province having Sena $X$, and at least one province having Sena $Y$.\n\nThis way, he can ensure the safety of his Kingdom.\n \nYou are the only programmer that Khilji has.
