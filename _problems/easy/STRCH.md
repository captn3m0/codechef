<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>### Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL19/hindi/STRCH.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL19/bengali/STRCH.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL19/mandarin/STRCH.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL19/russian/STRCH.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/APRIL19/vietnamese/STRCH.pdf) as well.

Shlok and Sachin are good friends. Shlok wanted to test Sachin, so he wrote down a string $S$ with length $N$ and one character $X$. He wants Sachin to find the number of different substrings of $S$ which contain the character $X$ at least once. Sachin is busy with his girlfriend, so he needs you to find the answer.

Two substrings of $S$ are considered different if their positions in $S$ are different.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. 
- The second line contains a string $S$ with length $N$, followed by a space and a character $X$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of substrings of $S$ that contain $X$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters
- $X$ is a lowercase English letter
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
3
abb b
6
abcabc c
```

### Example Output
```
5
15
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The string "abb" has six substrings: "a", "b", "b", "ab", "bb", "abb". The substrings that contain 'b' are "b", "b", "ab", "bb", "abb".
