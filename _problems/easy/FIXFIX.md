Given a positive integer $n$ and an integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$, find any permutation $A$ of $1, 2 \dots n$ such that the number of indices for which $A_i=i$ is exactly $k$. If there exists no such permutation, print $-1$. If there exist multiple such permutations, print any one of them.
