{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"EXUND","problem_name":"Chipped Tree","body":"You are given a tree with $N$ nodes, which are numbered from $1$ to $N$. It is rooted at Node $1$. We define a single $operation$ as follows :- \r\n- Put a chip on the root.\r\n- Within an operation, you can \"move\" as many times as you like.\r\n- A move is defined as picking a node which has a chip on it and then removing the chip from that node and placing a chip on all of its children. \r\n\r\nA node is covered if it has at least $1$ chip placed on it.\r\nYou can do at most $K$ operations. What is the maximum number of covered nodes that you can obtain?  \r\n\r\nNote that there is no constraint on the amount of chips placed on any node.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- The input contains a single integer, $T$, which denotes the number of testcases.\r\n- The first line of each testcase will contain two integers, $N$ and $K$, denoting the number of nodes and operations allowed, respectively.\r\n- The next $N-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ indicating that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$ in the tree.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\n- The output should consist of $T$ integers printed on separate lines.
