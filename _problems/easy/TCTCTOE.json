In a turn, a player chooses an empty cell and places their symbol on the cell. The players take alternating turns, where the player with the first turn uses the symbol $X$ and the other player uses the symbol $O$. The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol ($X$ or $O$), and the player with that token is declared the winner.
