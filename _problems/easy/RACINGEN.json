At the start, she has $X$ units of energy. For each subsequent **second**, she can decide to run or to rest (she must perform the chosen action during the whole second). If she runs, she loses one unit of energy during that second and if she rests, she gains one unit of energy during that second. However, if Ann decides to rest when she has $X$ units of energy, she does not gain any extra energy. Naturally, she cannot decide to run if she has $0$ units of energy.\r\n\r\nAnn needs to run for $R$ **minutes** to reach the goal and she needs to reach it within $M$ **minutes**. Is Ann able to finish the race on time?\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
