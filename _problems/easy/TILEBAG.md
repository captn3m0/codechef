All submissions for this problem are available.Kajaria has an empty bag and 2 types of tiles - tiles of type $1$ have the number $X$ written and those of type $2$ have the number $Y$ written on them. He has an infinite supply of both type of tiles. In one move, Kajaria adds exactly $1$ tile to the bag. He adds a tile of type $1$ with probability $p$ and a tile of type $2$ with probability $(1 - p)$. If $2$ tiles in the bag have the same number written on them (say $Z$), they are merged into a single tile of twice that number ($2Z$). Find the expected number of moves to reach the first tile with number $S$ written on it. \*\*Notes on merging\*\*: - Consider that the bag contains tiles $(5, 10, 20, 40)$ and if the new tile added is $5$, then it would merge with the existing $5$ and the bag would now contain $(10, 10, 20, 40)$. The tiles $10$ (already present) and $10$ (newly formed) would then merge in the same move to form $(20, 20, 40)$, and that will form $(40, 40)$, which will form $(80)$. Kajaria guarantees that: - $X$ and $Y$ are not divisible by each other. - A tile with number $S$ can be formed. ###Input - First line contains a single integer $T$ - the total no. of testcases - Each testcase is described by $2$ lines: 1. $X, Y, S$ - $3$ space-separated natural numbers 2. $u, v$ - $2$ space-separated natural numbers describing the probability $p$ The value of $p$ is provided as a fraction in its lowest form $u/v$ ($u$ and $v$ are co-prime) ###Output - For each testcase, if the expected number of moves can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ in its lowest form, print $(p \* q^{-1})$ modulo $10^9 + 7$, where $q^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $q$ wrt $10^9 + 7$. ###Constraints - $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$ - $2 \\leq X, Y \\leq 5 \* 10^{17}$ - $1 \\leq S \\leq 10^{18}$ - $1 \\leq u
