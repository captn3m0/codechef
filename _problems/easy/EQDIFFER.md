### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/EQDIFFER.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/EQDIFFER.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/EQDIFFER.pdf) as well.

You are given an array of $N$ integers. Find the *minimum* number of integers you need to delete from the array such that the absolute difference between each pair of integers in the remaining array will become equal.
