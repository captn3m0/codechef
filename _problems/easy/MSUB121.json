This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^6$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n- The sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You are given an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N]$ containing $N$ elements.
