Chef has an array consisting of $N + K - 1$ integers. The array contains only the first $N$ **positive odd numbers**. Each number appears **exactly once**, except for one number which appears **exactly $K$ times**. The sum of integers in Chef's array is equal to $S$.

For example, for $N = 3$, $K = 2$, the possible arrays could be $[1, 1, 3, 5]$, $[3, 1, 3, 5]$, $[5, 3, 5, 1]$. For $N = 1$, $K = 3$, there is only one possible array: $[1, 1, 1]$.

Chef gives you three integers $N$, $K$ and $S$ and asks you to find the only element which appears **$K$ times** in his array.

It is guaranteed that for the given input, there exists a valid array consisting of $N + K -1$ elements with a sum exactly equal to $S$.
