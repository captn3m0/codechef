### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/mandarin/CHEF7UP.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/bengali/CHEF7UP.pdf), and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/russian/CHEF7UP.pdf) as well.

Chef is a wanted criminal, and $N$ police officers are up for catching him. The officers want to catch Chef no matter the cost, and Chef also wants to eliminate as many officers as possible (preferably everyone) before getting caught (or before running away after eliminating everyone). Neither the officers nor Chef will run away before accomplishing their goals.

Chef and the officers are on a one-dimensional grid with coordinates ranging from $-10^{10}$ to $10^{10}$. Chef is initially standing at coordinate $C$, and the $i$-th officer is initially at coordinate $P_i$. The officers and Chef then take turns to move, with the officer team moving first. 

During their turn, officers will have to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell one by one, in any order they want. Every officer will have to move. At every moment of time, no two officers can be in the same cell, and also no officer can be in the same cell as Chef. If the officer is unable to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell, he is eliminated (and the cell he was in becomes unoccupied). **Note that the officer team will try to move to eliminate as few officers as possible.** For example, with $P = [2, 3, 4]$ and $C = 6$, then the next positions of the officers can be $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 2, 5]$, $[1, 4, 5]$, or $[3, 4, 5]$. However, with $P = [2, 3, 4]$ and $C = 5$, the only possible set of the next positions of the officers is $[1, 2, 3]$.

After the officer team's turn, Chef also moves to an adjacent unoccupied cell, or gets caught if he cannot find any adjacent unoccupied cell. The process then repeats until either Chef is caught, or all officers are eliminated and Chef runs away.

You need to find out the maximum number of officers that can be eliminated by Chef, and if Chef can run away or not.

As a reminder, two cells with coordinates $X$ and $Y$ are *adjacent* if and only if $|X - Y| = 1$.
