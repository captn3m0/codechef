<p>
Let's consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line, three in the third line, etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:</p>
<ul>
<li> on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;</li>
<li> the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100 </li>
<li> all numbers are positive integers between O and 99.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000).<br />
Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case write the determined value in a separate line. </p>
