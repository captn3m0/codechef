Fish City has $N$ vertical roads numbered $1, 2, ..., N$ from left to right, each spaced 1 unit apart; similarly, there are $M$ horizontal roads numbered $1, 2, ..., M$ from bottom to top, each spaced 1 unit apart. We will denote the intersection between the $x$-th vertical road and the $y$-th horizontal road as $(x, y)$. \r\n\r\nSalmon has to make $K$ deliveries, with the $i$-th delivery starting at $(x_i, y_i)$ and ending at $(x'_i, y'_i)$. He can also travel every road with speed $0.5$ (meaning it would take him $2$ units of time to travel $1$ unit of distance). However, Salmon can bribe the mayor of Fish City and make the mayor change **exactly one horizontal** road to a highway, meaning the speed on that road would increase to $1$.\r\n\r\nHe wants to choose a road to be a highway such that the sum of durations of all the deliveries is minimum possible.
