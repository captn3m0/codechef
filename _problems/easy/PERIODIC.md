Let's define a periodic infinite sequence $S$ ($0$-indexed) with period $K$ using the formula $S_i = (i \% K) + 1$.

Chef has found a sequence of positive integers $A$ with length $N$ buried underground. He suspects that it is a contiguous subsequence of some periodic sequence. Unfortunately, some elements of $A$ are unreadable. Can you tell Chef the longest possible period $K$ of an infinite periodic sequence which contains $A$ (after suitably filling in the unreadable elements) as a contiguous subsequence?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. 
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. Unreadable elements are denoted by $-1$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line.
- If the period can be arbitrarily large, this line should contain a single string `"inf"`.
- Otherwise, if $A$ cannot be a contiguous subsequence of a periodic sequence, it should contain a single string `"impossible"`.
- Otherwise, it should contain a single integer â€” the maximum possible period.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 10^5$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$
- for each valid $i$, $1 \le A_i \le 10^6$ or $A_i = -1$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $2 \le N \le 1,000$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input

### Example Output
