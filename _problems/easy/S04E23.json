This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $-10^6 \\leq P, Q \\leq 10^6$\n- $S$ contains $0, 1$ only.\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":true,"statement":"<em>Even before they leave the apartment, Joey drives Chandler crazy by forgetting everything useful, even his passport, but crying every five seconds \"London, baby!\", and photographing absolutely everything all the time, as if 6 hours on an airplane with Monica weren't bad enough.

Chandler has a set of instructions for Joey to move. He provides Joey a binary string $S$ of length $N$. Joey chooses one of the axes : either x-axis or y-axis. Joey then follows the instructions. To follow the $i^{th}$ instruction:\n\n- If $S_i$ = $0$, Joey has to change his axis immediately and move in any direction (positive or negative) of the resulting axis by $1$ unit. \n\n- If $S_i$ = $1$, Joey can move in any direction (positive or negative) along the current axis by $1$ unit.\n\nFor x-axis, moving in positive direction implies moving from $(x, y)$ to $(x+1, y)$ and moving in negative direction implies moving from $(x,y)$ to $(x-1, y)$. Similarly, for y-axis, moving in positive direction implies moving from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y+1)$ and moving in negative direction implies moving from $(x,y)$ to $(x, y-1)$.\n\nDetermine if Joey can reach $(P,Q)$ at the end.","inputFormat":"- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.
