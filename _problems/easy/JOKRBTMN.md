During a fight with the Joker, Batman's eyes lose the capability to distinguish between some pairs of colors.

Each color has an integer ID from $1$ to $N$. There are $M$ lists where each color belongs to exactly one list. Batman can distinguish colors belonging to different lists, but he cannot distinguish colors belonging to the same list.

Given a strip of $L$ colors, find the different number of segments Batman will see as a result of his disability. Two positions of the strip are said to belong to the same segment if they are adjacent on the strip and Batman cannot distinguish their colors. See the sample explanation for clarity.
