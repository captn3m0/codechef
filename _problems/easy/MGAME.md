Chef is playing a game with two of his friends. In this game, each player chooses an integer between $1$ and $P$ inclusive. Let's denote the integers chosen by Chef, friend 1 and friend 2 by $i$, $j$ and $k$ respectively; then, Chef's score is
$$(((N\,\mathrm{mod}\,i)\,\mathrm{mod}\,j)\,\mathrm{mod}\,k)\,\mathrm{mod}\,N\,.$$

Chef wants to obtain the maximum possible score. Let's denote this maximum score by $M$. Find the number of ways to choose the triple $(i, j, k)$ so that Chef's score is equal to $M$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $P$.
 
### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of ways to obtain the maximum score.
 
### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^6$
- $1 \le N \le P \le 10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le P \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** original constraints
  
### Example Input
```
2
4 4
3 4
```

### Example Output
```
9
13
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Chef's maximum possible score is $M = 1$. All possible values of $(i, j, k)$ such that the score is $1$ are
$(3, 2, 2)$,
$(3, 2, 3)$,
$(3, 2, 4)$,
$(3, 3, 2)$,
$(3, 3, 3)$,
$(3, 3, 4)$,
$(3, 4, 2)$,
$(3, 4, 3)$,
$(3, 4, 4)$.
