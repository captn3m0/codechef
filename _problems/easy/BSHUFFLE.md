Consider the following algorithm, which generates a (not necessarily uniformly) random permutation of numbers $1$ through $N$:

```
P := [1, 2, ..., N]
for i in 1..N do
    j := rand(1, N)
    swap(P[i], P[j])
```

Here, `rand(1, N)` returns a uniformly random integer between $1$ and $N$ inclusive. Let's denote the probability that the permutation generated by this algorithm is $P$ by $p(P)$.

Find a permutation $P_1$ such that $p(P_1)$ is maximum possible and a permutation $P_2$ such that $p(P_2)$ is minimum possible.

### Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
Print two lines. The first line should contain $N$ space-separated integers denoting your permutation $P_1$. The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers denoting your permutation $P_2$.

If there are multiple answers, you may print any one.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N \le 17$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $1 \le N \le 7$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
```

### Example Output
```
1 2
2 1
```

### Explanation
There are two possible permutations, $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 1]$. Both are equally likely to appear as the result of the given algorithm, so any pair of permutations is a valid answer.
