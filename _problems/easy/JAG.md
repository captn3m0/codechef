### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/JAG.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/bengali/JAG.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/JAG.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/JAG.pdf) as well.

You are given an undirected graph with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th node has a weight $W_i$. Also, for each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, there is an edge connecting these nodes if $j - i \neq W_j - W_i$.

Find the number of connected components in this graph.
