In the store, they offer $N$ cans of coke (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the current temperature of the $i$-th can is $C_i$ and its price is $P_i$.\r\n\r\nAfter buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef $M$ minutes to get home from the store. However, Chef does not know the value of $M$ yet.\r\n\r\nThe ambient temperature outside is $K$. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is $t$ at some point in time:\r\n- if $t \\gt K+1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $t-1$\r\n- if $t \\lt K-1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $t+1$\r\n- if $K-1 \\le t \\le K+1$, then one minute later, its temperature will be $K$\r\n\r\nWhen Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive). For each $i$ between $1$ and $Q$ inclusive, find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied when $M = i$ or determine that there is no such can.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $Q$, $K$, $L$ and $R$.\r\n- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $C_i$ and $P_i$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $Q$ space-seperated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers should be the answer for $M = i$: the price of the can Chef should buy, or $-1$ if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\r\n- $1 \\le N, Q \\le 10^5$\r\n- $|C_i| \\le 10^5$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $|K| \\le 10^5$\r\n- $-10^5 \\le L \\le R \\le 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\r\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\r\n- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (30 points):**\r\n- $N, Q \\le 1,000$\r\n- $|C_i| \\le 10^3$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $|K| \\le 10^3$\r\n- $-10^3 \\le L \\le R \\le 10^3$\r\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$\r\n- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3 2 5 4 6\r\n1 6\r\n2 8\r\n8 10\r\n3 5 10 20 30\r\n21 20\r\n22 22\r\n23 23\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n-1 8\r\n20 22 23 -1 -1\r\n```\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME75\/hindi\/COKE2.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME75\/bengali\/COKE2.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME75\/mandarin\/COKE2.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME75\/russian\/COKE2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME75\/vietnamese\/COKE2.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nChef went to the store in order to buy one can of coke.
