After playing one game for a long time, they decided to invent another game!\n\nIn this game, they have a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N$ and two numbers $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. The rules of the game are as follows:\n- The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.\n- There is an integer $S$; at the beginning, $S = 0$.\n- In each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of $A$ and either add that number to $S$ or subtract it from $S$. Each element can be selected multiple times.\n- Afterwards, if $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$, the current player (the player who made $S$ equal to $Z_1$ or $Z_2$) is the winner of the game.\n- If the game lasts for $10^{10}$ turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.\n\nCan you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$ in the first $10^{10}$ moves).\n\nBoth players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move. If the current player cannot win and there is a move which guarantees that the game will end in a tie, the current player will make such a move.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N$.\n\n### Output\n- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the final result of the game:\n    - $1$ if Vanja (the first player) has a winning strategy\n    - $2$ if Miksi (the second player) has a winning strategy\n    - $0$ if the game ends in a tie\n \n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 50$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 50$\n- $|Z_1|, |Z_2| \\le 10^9$\n- $|A_i| \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (25 points):** $N = 2$\n\n**Subtask #2 (75 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n2 6 4\n-4 10\n1 1 -1\n2\n2 0 7\n3 4\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1\n0\n2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** The first player can choose the value $A_1 = -4$, subtract it from $S = 0$ and obtain $S = - (-4) = 4 = Z_2$. The winner is the first player.  \n\n**Example case 2:** It can be proven that neither player is able to reach $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$. The result is a tie.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"allllekssssa","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>allllekssssa<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"24-08-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ad-hoc'>ad-hoc<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/allllekssssa'>allllekssssa<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/game'>game<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime63'>ltime63<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/JAGAM","time":{"view_start_date":1535216402,"submit_start_date":1535216402,"visible_start_date":1535216402,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472949},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
