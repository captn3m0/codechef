After six days, professor GukiZ decided to give more candies to his students. Like last time, he has $N$ students, numbered $1$ through $N$. Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the $i$-th student by $p\_i$. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence $p$: - The numbers of candies given to each of the first $K$ students ($p\_1, p\_2, \\dots, p\_K$) are known exactly. - All elements of the sequence $p$ are distinct and positive. - GukiZ didn't give more than $x$ candies to any student (the maximum value in the sequence $p$ is not greater than $x$). - For each student $i$, there is at least one other student $j$ such that $|p\_i - p\_j| \\le D$. - The professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. $S = p\_1 + p\_2 + p\_3 + \\ldots + p\_N$ is maximum possible. GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies $S$ he had at the beginning. However, times change and after six days, the professor is really tired, so it is possible that there is no sequence $p$ which satisfies the constraints. Can you help GukiZ find the number of candies he gave out, or tell him that he must have made a mistake? ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $K$, $x$, $D$. - The second line contains $K$ distinct space-separated integers $p\_1, p\_2, \\dots, p\_K$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of candies GukiZ had, or $-1$ if there is no valid sequence $p$. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 50$ - $3 \\le N \\le 10^9$ - $1 \\le K \\le \\mathrm{min}(N, 2 \\cdot 10^4)$ - $1 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$ - $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$ - $1 \\le p\_i \\le x$ for each valid $i$ - All values $p\_i$ from input are distinct ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (15 points):\*\* $1 \\leq x, N, D \\leq 15$ \*\*Subtask #2 (35 points):\*\* $1 \\leq x, N, D \\leq 10^5$ \*\*Subtask #3 (50 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 2 4 3 5 3 2 1 5 3 2 8 2 3 8 ``` ### Example Output ``` 12 -1 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* There are four students. We know that the first student got $p\_1 = 2$ candies, the second student got $p\_2 = 1$ and the third got $p\_3 = 5$ candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is $x=5$. The best possible option is giving $p\_4=4$ candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with $D=3$) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students $(2, 3)$ have numbers of candies that differ by more than $3$, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies. \*\*Example case 2:\*\* GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence $p$. The answer is $-1$.
