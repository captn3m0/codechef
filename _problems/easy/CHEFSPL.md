All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH16/mandarin/CHEFSPL.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH16/russian/CHEFSPL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH16/vietnamese/CHEFSPL.pdf) as well.

One day, Chef prepared **D** brand new dishes. He named the i-th dish by a string **Si**. After the cooking, he decided to categorize each of these **D** dishes as *special* or not.

A dish **Si** is called *special* if it's name (i.e. the string **Si**) can be represented in the form of a *double* string by removing at most one (possibly zero) character from it's name from any position.

A string is called a *double* string if it can be represented as a concatenation of two identical, non-empty strings.
e.g. "abab" is a double string as it can be represented as "ab" + "ab" where + operation denotes concatenation.
Similarly, "aa", "abcabc" are double strings whereas "a", "abba", "abc" are not.

### Input

- First line of the input contains an integer **D** denoting the number of dishes prepared by Chef on that day.
- Each of the next **D** lines will contain description of a dish. 
    - The i-th line contains the name of i-th dish **Si**.

### Output

For each of the **D** dishes, print a single line containing "**YES**" or "**NO**" (without quotes) denoting whether the dish can be called as a *special* or not.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **D** ≤ **106**
- **1** ≤ **|Si|** ≤ **106**.
- Each character of string **Si** will be lower case English alphabet (i.e. from 'a' to 'z').

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 : (20 points)**

- Sum of **|Si|** in an input file doesn't exceed **2 \* 103**

**Subtask 2 : (80 points)**

- Sum of **|Si|** in an input file doesn't exceed **2 \* 106**

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
3
aba
abac
abcd

<b>Output:</b>
YES
NO
NO

</pre>
### Explanation

**Example case 1.**
We can remove the character at position 1 (0-based index) to get "aa" which is a *double* string. Hence, it is a *special* dish.

**Example case 2.**
It is not possible to remove the character at any of the position to get the double string. Hence, it is not a *special* dish.
