### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME94/russian/MKSMEVN.pdf)

Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. In one operation, Chef can choose one index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$) and change $A_i$ to $A_i^p$, where $p = \max\left(0, {\lceil \frac{A_i}{2} \rceil} - 1\right)$.

Help Chef find the smallest number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the sequence even, or $-1$ if it is impossible.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):**
- $N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
4
7 3 5 1
5
4 2 7 8 10
2
9 9
3
1 1 1
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
0
-1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The sum of the sequence is $16$, which is already even.

**Example case 2:** We can change $A_2$ to $1$, so that the sequence becomes $[4, 1, 7, 8, 10]$. The sum of this sequence is $30$, which is even.

**Example case 3:** The sum of the sequence is $18$, which is already even.

**Example case 4:** It is impossible to make the sum of the sequence even.
