Chef's exam is near. There is a total of $M$ subjects in his syllabus. Each subject consists of several topics. However, the questions will be set only from $N$ topics. These topics are numbered $1$ through $N$. The $i^{th}$ topic belongs to $C_i^{th}$ subject and takes $T_i$ hours to cover.


Chef has only $K$ hours left before the exam and wants to score the maximum marks. If Chef covers $x_1$ number of topics of the $1^{st}$ subject, $x_2$ number of topics of the $2^{nd}$ subject, and so on upto  $x_M$ number of topics of the $M^{th}$ subject in the remaining $K$ hours, he will get a total of $\lceil \frac{x_1}{2} \ \rceil + \lceil \frac{x_2}{2} \ \rceil + \cdots + \lceil \frac{x_M}{2} \ \rceil$ marks in the exam. So Chef chooses the topics optimally.

Determine the maximum possible marks Chef can score in the exam.

**Note:** $\lceil x \rceil$ : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$ (i.e  rounds up to the nearest integer). For example, $\lceil 1.5 \rceil = 2$, $\lceil 5 \rceil = 5$.
