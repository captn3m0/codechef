This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- sum of $N$ over all testcases $\\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$ for all valid $i$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/mandarin\/INSIDER.pdf) [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/vietnamese\/INSIDER.pdf), and [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCK1B21\/russian\/INSIDER.pdf)\n\nYou are given an array $A$ with $N$ positive integers.\n\nAn $x$-insider of this array is a [subsequence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Subsequence) of $A$ such that $x$ is **strictly** in between any two consecutive elements of the subsequence. \n\nMore formally, a subsequence $S = [s_0, s_1, \\dots s_{k-1}]$ of the array $A$ is an $x$-insider if for every integer $i$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq k-1$, either\n- $s_{i-1} \\lt x \\lt s_{i}$ or\n- $s_{i-1} \\gt x \\gt s_{i}$\n\nFor example, for the array $[1, 4, 2, 4]$, the subsequence $[1, 4, 2]$ is a $3$-insider because $1 < 3 < 4$ and $4 > 3 > 2$. The subsequence $[1, 2]$ is **not** an $x$-insider for any integer $x$. The subsequence $[1, 4]$ is a $2$-insider as well as a $3$-insider. \n\nLet $m_k$ be the smallest **integer** such that $A$ contains an $m_k$-insider of length **exactly** $k$.

The subsequences $[1, 4], [1, 5], [4, 1]$ are $2$-insiders. All of them are $3$-insiders. The subsequences $[1, 5]$ and $[2, 5]$ are $4$-insiders. Thus $m_2 = 2$ and $M_2 = 4$.\n\n**Insiders of length $3$:** The subsequences of length $3$ that are $x$-insiders for some integer $x$ are $[1, 4, 1]$, $[2, 4, 1]$, and $[4, 1, 5]$. $[1, 4, 1]$ is both a $2$-insider and a $3$-insider; $[2, 4, 1]$ is only a $3$-insider; and $[4, 1, 5]$ is both a $2$-insider and a $3$-insider. Thus $m_3 = 2$ and $M_3 = 3$.\n\n**Insiders of length $4$:** The subsequences of length $4$ that are $x$-insiders for some integer $x$ are $[1, 4, 1, 5]$ and $[2, 4, 1, 5]$. $[1, 4, 1,5]$ is both a $2$-insider and a $3$-insider ; and $[2, 4, 1, 5]$ is a $3$-insider. Thus $m_4 = 2$ and $M_4 = 3$.\n\n**Insiders of length $5$:** The only subsequence of length $5$ is the array $A$ itself, which is not an $x$-insider for any integer value of $x$. Thus $m_5 = M_5 = -1$.\n\nHence the answers for this testcase are $m = [2, 2, 2, -1]$ and $M = [4, 3, 3, -1]$.\n\n**Test Case 2:** The given array is $[1, 1, 1]$. Since all elements are equal, none of the subsequences of this array are $x$-insiders (for any integer $x$). Hence the answers are $m = [-1, -1]$ and $M = [-1, -1]$.\n\n**Test Case 3:** The only subsequence (of length at least $2$) that is an $x$-insider (for **integer** values of $x$) is $[3, 1]$ which is a $2-$insider.
