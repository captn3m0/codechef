### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY20/hindi/PTMSSNG.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY20/bengali/PTMSSNG.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY20/mandarin/PTMSSNG.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY20/russian/PTMSSNG.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/JULY20/vietnamese/PTMSSNG.pdf) as well.

Chef has $N$ axis-parallel rectangles in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. These rectangles may intersect, but it is guaranteed that all their $4N$ vertices are pairwise distinct.

Unfortunately, Chef lost one vertex, and up until now, none of his fixes have worked (although putting an image of a point on a milk carton might not have been the greatest idea after all...). Therefore, he gave you the task of finding it! You are given the remaining $4N-1$ points and you should find the missing one.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Then, $4N-1$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ denoting a vertex $(x, y)$ of some rectangle.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ â€• the coordinates of the missing point. It can be proved that the missing point can be determined uniquely.

### Constraints
- $T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $|x|, |y| \le 10^9$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):**
- $T = 5$
- $N \le 20$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $|x|, |y| \le 10^5$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
2
1 1
1 2
4 6
2 1
9 6
9 3
4 3
```

### Example Output
```
2 2
```

### Explanation

The original set of points are:

Upon adding the missing point $(2, 2)$, $N = 2$ rectangles can be formed:
