She immediately requested her mom to give her the new marbles, but, her mom had some tricks kept up her sleeve:<\/p>\n<p>Mom: \"Not so fast, young girl!! These won't come for free! If you want to keep playing with them, you must prove you deserve them!!\"<\/p>\n<p>Lira: *<b>moans<\/b>* \"Alright, mom, what do I have to do now?\"<\/p>\n<p>(Yes, Lira's mom can be quite annoying)<\/p>\n<p>Mom: \"Well, you can assume that I have an array A of size <b>N<\/b> , where <b>N<\/b> is the total number of students I will give marbles to, and A[i] is the number of marbles each student initially has.\"<\/p>\n<p>Lira: *<b>smiles slightly<\/b>* \"So you're feeling generous hum?\"<\/p>\n<p>Mom: \"Well, not too generous... imagine I wanted to give more marbles to some of your school friends who do well on their exams, or, on the other hand take away some marbles from the greedier friends.\"<\/p>\n<p>Lira: \"Mom, c'mon that's too easy!!\"<\/p>\n<p>Mom: \"Alright, so given a group of students, starting on student <b>i<\/b> and ending on student <b>j<\/b>, I want to know how many marbles they have together!\"<\/p>\n<p>Well, it turns out that Lira actually did solve this problem and she did it very efficiently!!<\/p>\n<p>It's now your turn to solve the problem that Lira already did in a brilliant way!<\/p>\n<h3>Formal description:<\/h3>\n<p>Lira is given array <b>A<\/b>, which contains elements between 1000 and 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Three types of queries can be performed on this array: add a given value to a single element on it, subtract a given value from a single element on it and find the sum of the values between indexes i and j, i.e. A[i]+...+A[j]. Check input and example section for details.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains two integers: <b>N<\/b> and <b>Q<\/b>, denoting respectively, the number of students that there are present to receive the marbles as a gift and the number of actions Lira's mom will perform.<\/p>\n<p>These actions can be of three different types:<\/p>\n<li><b>S i j<\/b> - if the mom wants to find the sum of the number of marbles from students i to j.<\/li>\n<li><b>G i num_marbles<\/b> - if the mom decides to give num_marbles to student i<\/li>\n<li><b>T i num_marbles<\/b> - if the mom decides to take away num_marbles from student i<\/li>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>The output should contain as many lines as the number of queries S and it should contain the answer for each query on a separate line<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 <b>1000000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>3<\/b> \u2264 <b>Q<\/b> \u2264 <b>50000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>The array is 0-indexed.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1000<\/b> \u2264 <b>A[i]<\/b> \u2264 <b>2000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>A student can never have a negative value of marbles.
