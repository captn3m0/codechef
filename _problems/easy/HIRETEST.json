Each candidate needs to solve $3$ or more problems completely, or $2$ problems completely and $2$ or more problems partially. Only the first and the second candidates satisfy this.\r\n\r\n- **Sample Test 2:** The candidates need to either solve at least one problem completely, or they need to solve three or more problems partially. Only candidates $1$ and $3$ satisfy this.\r\n\r\n- **Sample Test 3:** The candidate needs to either solve two or more problems completely, or solve at least one problems completely and two problems partially. The candidate does not satisfy this.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. $N$ candidates appeared for the test, and each of them faced $M$ problems.
