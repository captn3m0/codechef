Raj is a math pro and number theory expert. One day, he met his age-old friend Chef. Chef claimed to be better at number theory than Raj, so Raj gave him some fuzzy problems to solve. In one of those problems, he gave Chef a $3$-tuple of non-negative integers $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ and told Chef to convert it to another tuple $(x, y, z)$.

Chef may perform the following operations any number of times (including zero) on his current tuple $(a, b, c)$, in any order:
- Choose one element of this tuple, i.e. $a$, $b$ or $c$. Either add $1$ to that element or subtract $1$ from it. The cost of this operation is $1$.
- Merge: Change the tuple to $(a-1, b-1, c+1)$, $(a-1, b+1, c-1)$ or $(a+1, b-1, c-1)$, i.e. add $1$ to one element and subtract $1$ from the other two. The cost of this operation is $0$.
- Split: Change the tuple to $(a-1, b+1, c+1)$, $(a+1, b-1, c+1)$ or $(a+1, b+1, c-1)$, i.e. subtract $1$ from one element and add $1$ to the other two. The cost of this operation is also $0$.

After each operation, all elements of Chef's tuple must be non-negative. It is not allowed to perform an operation that would make one or more elements of this tuple negative.

Can you help Chef find the minimum cost of converting the tuple $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ to the tuple $(x, y, z)$? It can be easily proved that it is always possible to convert any tuple of non-negative integers to any other.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers $a_0$, $b_0$, $c_0$, $x$, $y$ and $z$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum cost.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $0 \le a_0, b_0, c_0, x, y, z \le 10^{18}$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** $0 \le a_0, b_0, c_0, x, y, z \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1 1 1 2 2 2
1 2 3 2 4 2
```

### Example Output
```
0
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The tuple $(1, 1, 1)$ can be converted to $(2, 2, 2)$ using only three Split operations, with cost $0$: $(1, 1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 0, 2) \rightarrow (1, 1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 2, 2)$.

**Example case 2:** We can use one addition operation and one Split operation: $(1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (1, 3, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4, 2)$.
