After hosting a few races, he realised that people do not come there to see the race itself, they come to see racers crash into each other (what's wrong with our generation...).

All racers move with the constant speed $1$ metre per second. The lengths of cars are negligible, but the track is only wide enough for one car, so whenever two cars have the same position along the track, they crash into each other and the direction of movement of each of these cars changes (from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa).
