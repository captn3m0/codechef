This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N, M \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $2 \\leq A_i, B_j \\leq 10^9$ for every $1\\leq i \\leq N$ and $1\\leq j \\leq M$\n- $2 \\leq P \\leq 10^9$\n- $P$ is a prime number\n- Sum of $N$ across all test cases will not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- Sum of $M$ across all test cases will not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Chef and his friends would like to attend a large New Year's party in Goa.
