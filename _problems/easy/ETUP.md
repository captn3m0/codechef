### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/russian/ETUP.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/mandarin/ETUP.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/bengali/ETUP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START6/vietnamese/ETUP.pdf) as well.

You are given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers and $Q$ queries. Each query is described by two integers $L$ and $R$. For each query, output the number of tuples $(i, j, k)$ such that $L\le i\lt j\lt k\le R$ and $A_i+A_j+A_k$ is an even number.
