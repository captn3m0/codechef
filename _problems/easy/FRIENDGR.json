Given a *binary string* $S$ of length $N$, where $S_i =$ `'$1$'` denotes, there is a person standing in the $i^{th}$ position.\n\nThe distance between two people standing in the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ positions respectively in the queue is $\\mid i - j \\mid$, where $\\mid x \\mid$ denotes the absolute value of $x$. Now, two people are considered to be friends if they are at a distance less than or equal to $K$. \n\nLet's say, there are $M$ people, $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_M$ standing one after another in a queue such that for each $1 \\leq i \\lt M$, $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ are friends, then all the $M$ people are considered to be in a *friend group*.\n\nFor example, consider the string $S =$ `\"$1101001$\"` and $K = 2$. \n\nLet's denote the people standing in the $1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$, $4^{th}$ and $7^{th}$ positions in the queue by $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ respectively. Now, $P_1$ and $P_2$ are friends as the distance between them is $1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ are also friends as the distance between them is $2$. $P_4$ is not friend with anyone. Hence $P_1, P_2, P_3$ form a friend group and $P_4$ forms a separate friend group.\n\nNow each person can move one position right or one position left or stay in the same position. However, they can't move out of the queue. Find the *minimum* number of friend groups they can form if they move optimally.\n\nIt is possible that there is more than one person standing in the same position after the movements.\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5\\cdot10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq K \\leq N$\n- $S$ contains only characters '$0$` and '$1$'\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/START9\/mandarin\/FRIENDGR.pdf) and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/START9\/bengali\/FRIENDGR.pdf).\n\nThere are $N$ positions in a queue.
