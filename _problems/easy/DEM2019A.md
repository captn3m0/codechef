All submissions for this problem are available.$N$ Indian Air Force fighter planes are located in different bases across the country. Each airbase is described by some integer coordinate $(x,y)$. The Air Force plans to do surgical strikes on a maximum of $M$ different targets in enemy territory (which are also described by cartesian coordinates) and then come back to the common main airbase at coordinate $(baseX, baseY)$ . Each army base and the targets are recognised by a secret integer $ID$. The time taken for an aircraft to go from a base to a target is the prime factor of the Manhattan Distance between the base and the target that is just greater than the $ID$ of the source base (In case the $ID$ is greater than or equal to the largest prime factor, then consider the $ID$ itself). Similarly, the time taken for an aircraft to go from a target to the main base is the prime factor of the Manhattan Distance between the target and the main base that is just greater than the $ID$ of the target (In case the $ID$ is greater than or equal to the largest prime factor, then consider the $ID$ itself). Each Aircraft needs to leave the base, reach target and come back to the main base in a maximum time of $T$. One aircraft can go to only one target before going to the main base. Find the maximum number of targets that can be reached in the enemy territory. ###Input - The first line contains three space separated integers $N$, $M$ and $T$ respectively. - The next $N$ lines contain 3 integers denoting $x$ coordinate, $y$ coordinate and the $ID$ of the air bases. - The next $M$ lines contain 3 integers denoting $x$ coordinate, $y$ coordinate and the $ID$ of the targets. - The last line contains two integers denoting the $baseX$ and $baseY$ coordinate. ###Output Output a single integer which is the maximum number of targets that can be reached. ###Constraints - $ 1\\leq N,M \\leq 400$ - $ 0 \\leq x, y, baseX, baseY \\leq 5\*10^6$ - $ 0 \\leq ID \\leq 5000$ - $ 0 \\leq T \\leq10^7$ ###Sample Input 2 2 35 1 2 15 2 10 20 2 1 8 5 6 12 5 5 ###Sample Output 2 ###Sample Explanation Aircraft from first base can go to target 1 and then to the main base in time 23 and aircraft from second base can go to target 2 and then to the main base in time 32. So 2 targets can be reached in less than time T=35.
