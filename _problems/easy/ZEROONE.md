### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/mandarin/ZEROONE.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/bengali/ZEROONE.pdf), and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/russian/ZEROONE.pdf) as well.

You are handed a binary string $S$, but not in any ordinary form. Instead of being directly given the value of $S$, you are given an array $C$ of size $N$ representing the *01-compression representation* of $S$. This means $S$ first contains $C_1$ $\texttt{0}$ characters, then $C_2$ $\texttt{1}$ characters, then $C_3$ $\texttt{0}$ characters, and so on. For example, the array $C = [2, 3, 4, 3]$ corresponds with the binary string $\texttt{001110000111}$.

You are allowed to modify $S$ by swapping elements of $C$. More specifically, you are allowed to swap $C_i$ and $C_j$ *as long as* $C_i$ and $C_j$ both encodes blocks of the same character. For example, from $C = [2, 3, 4, 3]$, you can swap $C_1$ and $C_3$ because both of them encode blocks of $\texttt{0}$'s, turning $C$ to $[4, 3, 2, 3]$ and $S$ to $\texttt{000011100111}$. However, you cannot swap $C_1$ and $C_2$ because $C_1$ encodes a block of $\texttt{0}$'s, while $C_2$ encodes a block of $\texttt{1}$s.

Perform the swapping operation in any way as many times as you want (including zero times) so that the final string $S$ has as many $\texttt{01}$ subsequences as possible. As a reminder, a subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

You need to find any optimal final array $C$, for which the number of $\texttt{01}$ subsequence will be the largest possible.
