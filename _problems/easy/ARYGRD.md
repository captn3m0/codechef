All submissions for this problem are available.Arya is planning to go back to Winterfell. In order to reach there and survive, she must collect maximum stars from a maze. The maze is in the form of a grid of size $m \\times n$. Each cell is either blank, has a star or has a stone. She starts from $(1,1)$ to reach $(m, n)$ using right and bottom moves and then she returns to $(1, 1)$ using top and left moves. The only constraint is that if she visits some cells in a particular row in the whole journey (forward and backward), then maximum distance between any pair of visited cells (forward and backward) for every row is $x$, where $x$ is given in the input. Distance between $(i, j)$ and $(i, k)$ is $|k - j|$. \*\*Also note that she cannot go into the cells with a stone.\*\* Tell the maximum stars that can be collected by Arya. ###Input: - First line will contain three integers: $m$, number of rows, $n$, number of columns and $x$, the distance constraint. - Next $m$ lines contain the grid. Each line contains '.', '\*' or '#' denoting empty cell, star or stone. The cells $(1, 1)$ or $(m, n)$ can have stones. ###Output: Print the maximum number of stars that can be collected by Arya. If it is not possible to reach $(m, n)$ from $(1, 1)$, then print -1. ###Constraints - $1 \\leq m, n \\leq 1000$ - $0 \\leq x \\leq 5$ ###Sample Input: 3 3 0 .\*. \*.\* .\*. ###Sample Output: -1 ###EXPLANATION: If x = 0, then it is not possible to reach 3,3 as we cannot move left in any row.. ###Sample Input: 3 3 1 .\*. \*.\* .\*. ###Sample Output: 3 ###EXPLANATION: If x = 1, then we can at most visit 2 consecutive cells in any row. Thus (0,0) =&gt; (0,1) =&gt; (1,1) =&gt; (1,2) =&gt; (2,2) =&gt; (2,1) =&gt; (1,1) =&gt; (0,1) =&gt; (0,0) OR (0,0) =&gt; (1,0) =&gt; (1,1) =&gt; (2,1) =&gt; (2,2) =&gt; (2,1) =&gt; (1,1) =&gt; (0,1) =&gt; (0,0) Note that in this case, we cannot go to (1, 2) while returning as it will lead to maximum distance of 3 between (1,0) and (1,2). ###Sample Input: 3 3 2 .\*. \*.\* .\*. ###Sample Output: 4 ###EXPLANATION: (0,0) =&gt; (0,1) =&gt; (0,2) =&gt; (1,2) =&gt; (2,2) =&gt; (2,1) =&gt; (2,0) =&gt; (1,0) =&gt; (0,0)
