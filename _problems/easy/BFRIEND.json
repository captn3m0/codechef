Bob is not dressed properly and he does not wish to take any chances, so he wants to rush to an apartment of one of his $N$ friends, change there and meet Alice for the dinner.\r\n\r\nAlice and Bob's friends live in a skyscraper with many floors. Alice lives on the $a$-th floor, the apartments of Bob's friends are located on the floors $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_N$ and Bob is initially at the $b$-th floor. It takes exactly $1$ minute to go one floor up or down from each floor.\r\n\r\nBob needs exactly $c$ minutes to change in any of his friends' apartments.

The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $a$, $b$ and $c$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nPrint a single line containing one integer \u2015 the minimum time Bob needs.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^9$\r\n- $1 \\le F_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n3 1 5 2\r\n6 7 8\r\n1 1 2 1000000000\r\n1000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n8\r\n2999999997\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** In the optimal solution, Bob goes to his friend at floor $6$, changes there and goes to meet Alice.
