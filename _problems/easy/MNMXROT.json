This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 15 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9$\n- $C_i \\in$ $\\{`B`,`W`\\}$\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $15 \\cdot 10^5$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask $1$** (25 points): $ 1 \\le \\sum{N} \\le 10^5 $\n- **Subtask $2$** (75 points): original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Shamili has an array $A = [A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{N-1}]$ of length $N$. She painted each element of this array in either Black or White. \n\nShe allows you to right rotate the values in array $A$ by any value $k$. In other words, let $B$ be the resulting array after right rotating $A$ by $k$, then $B_i = A_{(i-k+n) \\pmod{N}}$ where $B_0$ and $A_0$ are the first elements in the arrays $A$ and $B$ respectively). Note that when you rotate the array $A$, their colors won't get rotated and only the values in it get rotated. For example, let the array $A$ be $[3,2,7,6]$ and their colors be $[$Black, Black, White, White$]$. Right rotating $A$ by $2$ will give you the array $[7,6,3,2]$ with colors $[$Black, Black, White, White$]$.\n\nLet $maxb$ be the maximum value among all the elements that are painted in Black and $minw$ be the minimum value among all the elements that are painted in White. Shamili asked you to find the maximum value of $maxb - minw$ after right rotating the array $a$ at most once.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one element in the array is colored in Black and at least one element is colored in White.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. $T$ test cases follow.\n- The first line of each test case contains the integer $N$.\n- The second line contains $N$ integers $A_0, A_1, A_2, ..., A_{N-1}$. Note that $A$ is 0-indexed.\n- The third line of each test case contains a string $C$ of size $N$ representing the color of each element. ($C_i = `B`$ if the $i^{th}$ element in array $A$ is painted in Black color and $C_i = `W`$ if the $i^{th}$ element is painted in White color). Note that $C$ is also 0-indexed, i.e. the first character of $C$ is $C_0$ and the last character is $C_{N-1}$.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each test case, output the maximum possible value of $maxb-minw$.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"2\n4\n5 1 2 6\nBWBW\n5\n1 8 2 9 3\nBBWBB\n","output":"4\n8\n","explanation":"- **Test case $1$**: When we right rotate the array by $1$, the resulting array will be $[6,5,1,2]$. Now the maximum value in Black elements is $6$ ($maxb$) and minimum value in White elements ($minw$) is $2$. Therefore, the answer will be $6-2 = 4$. It can be shown that this is the maximum result possible.\n\n- **Test case $2$**: We can convert the given array to $[9,3,1,8,2]$. So, the maximum value is $9-1 = 8$.\n","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"0.75","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"m0riarty","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>m0riarty<\/span>","problem_tester":"aryanc403","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>aryanc403<\/span>","date_added":"25-11-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime102'>ltime102<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/m0riarty'>m0riarty<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Easy-Medium","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/MNMXROT","time":{"view_start_date":1638032400,"submit_start_date":1638032400,"visible_start_date":1638032400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797848},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=MNMXROT","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
