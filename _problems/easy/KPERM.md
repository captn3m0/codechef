**Note**: For the problem KPERM, we have observed that PYPY3 performs better than Python3.

You are given integers $N$, $R$ and $K$. Consider all permutations of the integers $1$ through $N$ with exactly $R$ inversions. Find the $K$-th lexicographically smallest among these permutations.

Notes:
- The number of inversions in a permutation $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$ is the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i \lt j \le N$ and $P_i \gt P_j$.
- A permutation $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ is lexicographically smaller than a permutation $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$ if there is an index $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$) such that $A_i \lt B_i$ and for each valid $j \lt i$, $A_j = B_j$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $R$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If the lexicographically $K$-th smallest permutation with $R$ inversions does not exist, print a single line containing the integer $-1$.
- Otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers â€• the lexicographically $K$-th smallest permutation with $R$ inversions.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 500$
- $0 \le R \le 200,000$
- $1 \le K \le 10^{18}$

### Example Input
```
1
3 1 2
```

### Example Output
```
2 1 3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are two permutations with $1$ inversion: $[1, 3, 2]$ and $[2, 1, 3]$. The first permutation is lexicographically smaller than the second permutation.
