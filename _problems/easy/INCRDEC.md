Chef received a new sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. He does not like arbitrarily ordered sequences, so he wants to permute the elements of $A$ in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is an integer $p$ ($1 \le p \le N$) such that the first $p$ elements of the new (permuted) sequence are strictly increasing and the last $N-p+1$ elements are strictly decreasing.

Help Chef and find a permutation of the given sequence which satisfies this condition or determine that no such permutation exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If there is no permutation of $A$ that satisfies the given condition, print a single line containing the string `"NO"` (without quotes).
- Otherwise, print two lines.
- The first of these lines should contain the string `"YES"` (without quotes).
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers â€• the elements of your permuted sequence.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $N \le 10^3$
- $A_i \le 2 \cdot 10^3$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints
