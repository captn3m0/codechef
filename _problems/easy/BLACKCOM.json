The nodes are numbered from 1 to <b>N<\/b>, and each node is colored either white or black. You are given <b>Q<\/b> queries, where each query is of the form (<b>s<\/b>, <b>b<\/b>). You need to check if there is a connected subgraph of size exactly <b>s<\/b>, which contains exactly <b>b<\/b> black nodes.<\/p>\n\n<p>A subgraph H, of a tree T, is a graph whose vertex set V<sub>H<\/sub> is a subset of the nodes of the tree and the edges are exactly those edges of the tree whose both end points are in V<sub>H<\/sub>. A subgraph H is a connected subgraph if H is connected.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains a single integer, <b>T<\/b>, which denotes the number of testcases. The descriptions of the testcases follow.<\/li>\n<li>The first line of each testcase contains two integers, <b>N<\/b> and <b>Q<\/b>, which denotes the number of nodes in the tree, and the number of queries, respectively.<\/li>\n<li>The i-th of the next <b>N<\/b> - 1 lines contains two integers: <b>u<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>v<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. This denotes that there is an edge between nodes <b>u<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>v<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> in the tree.<\/li>\n<li>The next line contains <b>N<\/b> integers, <b>c<sub>1<\/sub>, c<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, .., <b>c<sub>N<\/sub><\/b>. <b>c<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> is 0 if node i is colored white, and it is 1 if it is colored black.<\/li>\n<li>The i-th of the next <b>Q<\/b> lines contains two integers: <b>s<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>b<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.

And it has exactly two black nodes (7 and 9). So, there is at least one connected subgraph of size exactly 3 which has exactly 2 black nodes. Hence the answer is \"Yes\".<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Query 2<\/b>: The subgraph containing the nodes {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} is a connected subgraph. And it has exactly three black nodes (2, 4 and 7). So, there is at least one connected subgraph of size exactly 7 which has exactly 3 black nodes. Hence the answer is \"Yes\".<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Query 3<\/b>: There is no connected subgraph of size exactly 4 with all white nodes. Hence the answer is \"No\".<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Query 4<\/b>: The only subgraph with 9 nodes is the entire tree itself. And it has 4 black nodes, and not 5.
