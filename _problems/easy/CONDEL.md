You are given a positive integer $K$ and a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Initially, each element of this sequence is $0$ or $1$; your goal is to make all elements equal to $0$.

In order to do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times:
- Choose a subarray (a contiguous subsequence) with length $K$, i.e. choose two indices $L$ and $R$ such that $1 \le L \le R \le N$ and $R-L+1 = K$.
- Choose one element of that subarray and change it to $0$, i.e. choose an index $P$ such that $L \le P \le R$ and change $A_P$ to $0$.
- The cost of this operation is the sum of this subarray $A_L + A_{L+1} + \ldots + A_R$ before $A_P$ is changed.

Find the minimum total cost (sum of costs of individual operations) of making all elements of $A$ equal to $0$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum cost of turning all elements of $A$ into zeros. 

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 200$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le 1$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \cdot 10^5$

### Example Input
```
3
5 3
1 0 1 0 1
4 4
1 1 0 1
3 1
1 1 0
```

### Example Output
```
3
6
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The minimum cost is $3$ and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:
- choose the subarray $[L,R] = [2,4]$ and set $A_3=0$ with cost $1$
- choose the subarray $[1,3]$ and set $A_1=0$ with cost $1$
- choose the subarray $[3,5]$ and set $A_5=0$ with cost $1$

**Example case 2:** We have to choose the whole sequence ($[L,R] = [1,4]$) in each operation, so the total cost is $3+2+1=6$:
- choose the subarray $[1,4]$ and set $A_1=0$ with cost $3$ 
- choose the subarray $[1,4]$ and set $A_2=0$ with cost $2$
- choose the subarray $[1,4]$ and set $A_4=0$ with cost $1$

**Example case 3:** The minimum cost is $2$ and it can be obtained using the following sequence of operations:
- choose the subarray $[2,2]$ and set $A_2=0$ with cost $1$
- choose the subarray $[1,1]$ and set $A_1=0$ with cost $1$
