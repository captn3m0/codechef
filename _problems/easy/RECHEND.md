You are given a positive integer $N$. Consider a square grid of size $N \times N$, with rows numbered  $1$ to $N$ from top to bottom and columns numbered $1$ to $N$ from left to right. Initially you are at $(1,1)$ and you have to reach $(N,N)$. From a cell you can either move one cell to the right or one cell down (if possible). Formally, if you are at $(i,j)$, then you can either move to $(i+1,j)$ if $i \lt N$, or to $(i,j+1)$ if $j \lt N$.

There are exactly $N$ blocks in the grid, such that each row contains exactly one block and each column contains exactly one block. You can't move to a cell which contains a block. It is guaranteed that blocks will not placed in $(1,1)$ and $(N,N)$.

You have to find out whether you can reach $(N,N)$.
