All submissions for this problem are available.There's a tree and every one of its nodes has a cost associated with it. Some of these nodes are labelled special nodes. You are supposed to answer a few queries on this tree. In each query, a source and destination node ($SNODE$ and $DNODE$) is given along with a value $W$. For a walk between $SNODE$ and $DNODE$ to be valid you have to choose a special node and call it the pivot $P$. Now the path will be $SNODE$ -&gt;$ P$ -&gt; $DNODE$. For any valid path, there is a path value ($PV$) attached to it. It is defined as follows: Select a subset of nodes(can be empty) in the path from $SNODE$ to $P$ (both inclusive) such that sum of their costs ($CTOT\_{1}$) doesn't exceed $W$. Select a subset of nodes(can be empty) in the path from $P$ to $DNODE$ (both inclusive) such that sum of their costs ($CTOT\_{2}$) doesn't exceed $W$. Now define $PV = CTOT\_{1} + CTOT\_{2}$ such that the absolute difference $x = |CTOT\_{1} - CTOT\_{2}|$ is as low as possible. If there are multiple pairs of subsets that give the same minimum absolute difference, the pair of subsets which maximize $PV$ should be chosen. For each query, output the path value $PV$ minimizing $x$ as defined above. Note that the sum of costs of an empty subset is zero. ###Input - First line contains three integers $N$ - number of vertices in the tree, $NSP$ - number of special nodes in the tree and $Q$ - number of queries to answer. - Second line contains $N-1$ integers. If the $i$th integer is $V\_i$ then there is an undirected edge between $i + 1$ and $V\_i$ ($i$ starts from $1$ and goes till $N-1$). - Third line contains $N$ integers, the $i$th integer represents cost of the $i$th vertex. - Fourth line contains $NSP$ integers - these represent which nodes are the special nodes. - Following $Q$ lines contains three integers each - $SNODE$, $DNODE$ and $W$ for each query. ###Output For each query output a single line containing a single integer - the path value $PV$ between $SNODE$ and $DNODE$. ###Constraints: - $1 \\leq $ Number of nodes $ \\leq 1000 $ - $ 0 \\leq W \\leq 1000 $ - $ 1 \\leq $ Number of special nodes $ \\leq 10 $ - $ 0 \\leq $ Cost of each node $ \\leq 1000 $ - $ 1 \\leq $ Number of queries $ \\leq 1000 $ ###Sample Input 7 1 5 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 5 4 2 7 9 1 1 2 3 100 1 1 100 2 1 100 4 5 100 4 7 100 ###Sample Output: 6 6 6 20 16 ###Explanation: Consider query $4$. The only path is $4-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;5$. The two sets defined for this path are {${3,2,5}$} and {${3,5,7}$}. Pick subsets {${3,2,5}$} and {${3,7}$} from each set which minimizes $PV$. Note that node $2$ can repeat as it is in different paths (both to and from the pivot).
