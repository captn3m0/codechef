{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"BUYING2","problem_name":"Buying Sweets","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Banknotes in the state of Strangeland don't have any regulated values like 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc. In fact, it's possible to see any positive integer on a banknote of Strangeland. Indeed, this isn't the most convenient thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ann is working as a sweet seller at a shop in Strangeland. Every kind of sweets in this shop has its own cost, and sweets of the same kind have the same cost.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Customers in Strangeland are strange. A customer points at some kind of sweets and gives several banknotes to the seller. This means that he wants to buy a positive number of sweets of that kind. He doesn't tell the exact number of sweets he wants to buy. The only thing Ann knows is: <b>an 'adequate' customer won't give any extra banknotes<\/b>. It means that if you throw away any banknote, the resulting amount of money won't be enough to buy the wanted number of sweets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ann has to determine the number of sweets the customer wants. Help Ann write a program which determines this number or tells that it's impossible.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T<\/b>, the number of test cases (no more than 20). <b>T<\/b> test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first of these lines contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>X<\/b> (1 \u2264 <b>N<\/b>, <b>X<\/b> \u2264 100) separated by a single space. <b>N<\/b> is the number of banknotes given by the customer. <b>X<\/b> is the cost of a single sweet of the chosen kind. The second of these lines contains <b>N<\/b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> (1 \u2264 <b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> \u2264 100), the values of the banknotes.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For each test case output exactly one line containing a single integer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>-1<\/b> if the customer is inadequate and has given extra banknotes, or<\/li>\n<li><b>K<\/b>, the number of sweets the customer wants to buy. If there are several possible answers, output the <b>largest<\/b> of them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n4 7\n10 4 8 5\n1 10\n12\n2 10\n20 50\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n-1\n1\n7\n<\/pre><h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the first test case, the total amount of money received from the customer is 27. He can't buy more than 3 sweets with this amount. If you throw away the banknote of value 5 (or of value 4), it will still be possible to buy 3 sweets. Hence the customer is inadequate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the second test case, it's clear that he wants to buy just one sweet (note that this number should be positive).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the third test case, the total amount of money received is 70, which is enough for 7 sweets. The customer might want to buy only 6 sweets, but we are interested in the largest possible answer.<\/p>\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, JAVA","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"gennady.korotkevich","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #D0011B;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>7&#9733;<\/span><span>gennady.korotkevich<\/span>","problem_tester":"gamabunta","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #666666;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>1&#9733;<\/span><span>gamabunta<\/span>","date_added":"4-10-2012","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ad-hoc'>\n                    ad-hoc\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook27'>\n                    cook27\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/gennady.korotkevich'>\n                    gennady.korotkevich\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1350845041,"submit_start_date":1350845041,"visible_start_date":1350845041,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493558111},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}
