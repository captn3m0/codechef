This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $S_i \\in \\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\}$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Not everything in Wasseypur is about gangs and guns. There are normal people too! Ashok is a simple farmer who has the misfortune of living in Wasseypur. He plants his seeds and works the land with his family like an honest man.  \n\nThrough his hard work and grit he can turn his seeds into lush crops. However, not all seeds are equal - some seeds are good, some are bad. Seeds can be one of $4$ types - $\\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\}$. Ashok goes to the farmer's market to buy some seeds where he meets Uday, an eccentric rich merchant. Ashok doesn't have enough money to buy all the seeds he can plant. Taking pity on him, Uday proposes a strange game.\n\nUday sets out $N$ seeds out in a pattern resembling a tree. Ashok can then choose **one** simple path in this tree and take every seed along this path. The path must not be empty, i.e, it should contain at least one vertex of the tree.\n\nThe total yield of the seeds Ashok receives equals the product of all their types. Given this tree and the type of seed placed at each vertex, what is the maximum yield Ashok can obtain?\n\nThe answer can be large, so print it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\nIf the answer is negative, print the *positive* remainder obtained on division by $10^9 + 7$ - that is, if the answer is $-1$, print $1000000006$.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
