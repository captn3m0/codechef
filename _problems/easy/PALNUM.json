There is no way to obtain a palindrome which is lexicographically larger than $95759$ using ten operations.\n  - In the second test case, there is no possible way to convert $1$ and $5$ into equal digits. So we can't obtain a palindrome.\n  - In the third test case, we convert the $6$ in the last index of the given string into $1$ using the $4$-th type of operation. So $S$ becomes $141741$. Next, we convert $1$ in the third index into $5$ using the $1$-st type of operation. So $S$ becomes $145741$. Then we convert the $5$ in the third index of $S$ into $7$ using the $2$-nd type of operation. So $S$ becomes $147741$. The total cost is $5 + 3 + 2 = 10$ coins and the string we obtain after all operations is a palindrome.
