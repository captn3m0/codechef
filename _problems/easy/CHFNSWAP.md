### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT20/hindi/CHFNSWAP.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT20/bengali/CHFNSWAP.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT20/mandarin/CHFNSWAP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT20/russian/CHFNSWAP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT20/vietnamese/CHFNSWAP.pdf) as well.

You are given a positive integer $N$. Consider the sequence $S = (1, 2, \ldots, N)$. You should choose two elements of this sequence and swap them.

A swap is *nice* if there is an integer $M$ ($1 \le M \lt N$) such that the sum of the first $M$ elements of the resulting sequence is equal to the sum of its last $N-M$ elements. Find the number of nice swaps.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of nice swaps.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10^6$
- $1 \le N \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $T \le 10$
- $N \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):**
- $T \le 10$
- $N \le 10^6$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints
