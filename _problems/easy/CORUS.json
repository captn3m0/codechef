He thought of a different situation where there are $26$ types of viruses, named \"**a**orona\", \"**b**orona\", \"**c**orona\", ..., \"**z**orona\".\r\n\r\nYou are given a string $S$ with length $N$. There are $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$) and for each valid $i$, the $i$-th person is infected by exactly one type of virus named $S_i$orona (i.e. \"corona\" with the first letter replaced by the $i$-th character of $S$).\r\n\r\nYou should answer $Q$ queries. In each query:\r\n- You are given an integer $C$ denoting the number of available *isolation centers*.\r\n- Each isolation center has an infinite capacity, but with the restriction that two people infected with the same type of virus cannot stay in the same isolation center.\r\n- There is also a *pending queue* with an infinite capacity and there are no restrictions on which people can be in the pending queue.\r\n- Initially, the isolation centers and pending queue are empty.\r\n- Each of the $N$ people should be placed in either the pending queue or one of the isolation centers.\r\n- Since Vinay is busy finding a vaccine, he asks Swapnil to find a way to place the people in the pending queue and isolation centers such that the number of people in the pending queue is the smallest possible.\r\n- Help Swapnil find the size of the pending queue in that case.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
