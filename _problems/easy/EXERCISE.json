{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"EXERCISE","problem_name":"Fitness Exercises ","body":"Recently, Chef has noticed that he is becoming fatter than ever. It is not surprising, as Chef is eating a lot of the food he is cooking. Therefore, he has been doing exercises for the last $N$ days (numbered $1$ through $N$). For some of these days, Chef remembers for how many minutes he exercised. You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$. For each valid $i$, if $A_i \\ge 0$, then Chef exercised for $A_i$ minutes on the $i$-th day; otherwise, Chef forgot how long he exercised on the $i$-th day and $A_i = -1$. Note that Chef could only have exercised for an integer non-negative number of minutes on each day, including the days he does not remember.\r\n\r\nChef can also compare how long he exercised on each two consecutive days. You are given a string $S$ with length $N-1$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:\r\n- '>' if Chef exercised for strictly more minutes on the $i$-th day than on the $(i+1)$-th day\r\n- '=' if Chef exercised for an equally long time on the $i$-th day and on the $(i+1)$-th day\r\n- '<' if Chef exercised for strictly more minutes on the $(i+1)$-th day than on the $i$-th day\r\n\r\nChef is doubting his memory, so he wants you to check if the information is consistent, i.e. if there is a way to determine for how many minutes Chef exercised on each day he does not remember such that the string $S$ describes the correct comparison operators.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
