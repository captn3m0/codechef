Yukti found a strange paper with a Boolean expression written on it. Unfortunately, all the operands were missing from this expression. Being an innovative person, Yukti immediately created a riddle for her students based on this incomplete expression.

The students are given a string $L$ describing a valid Boolean expression, where each operand (value) is replaced by the character '#'. A valid expression is defined as one of the following:
- A single term '#'.
- A string in the format "([expression1][operator][expression2])", where [expression1] and [expression2] are valid expressions and [operator] is one of the characters '&', '|' and '^' (denoting bitwise AND, OR and XOR respectively).

Each of the characters '#' in the string $L$ should be replaced by one of the characters '0', '1', 'a' and 'A', uniformly randomly and independently. Then, the resulting expression is evaluated as follows:
- A Boolean value $a$ ($0$ or $1$) is chosen. Each occurrence of the character 'a' is interpreted as this value and each occurrence of 'A' is interpreted as its negation ($1-a$). The characters '0' and '1' are interpreted as the Boolean values $0$ and $1$ respectively.
- Since there are two possible values of $a$, we obtain two constant Boolean expressions this way. Let's denote them by $G_0$ (when $a$ = 0) and $G_1$ (when $a$ = 1). 
- Let's evaluate $G_0$ and $G_1$.
    - If $G_0 = G_1 = 0$, the value of the expression is '0'.
    - If $G_0 = G_1 = 1$, the value of the expression is '1'.
    - If $G_0 = 0$ and $G_1 = 1$, the value of the expression is 'a'.
    - If $G_0 = 1$ and $G_1 = 0$, the value of the expression is 'A'.

Can you find the probabilities with which the expression obtained after substituting for each character '#' evaluates to these values? It can be proved that for each of these values, the probability can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are integers ($P \ge 0$, $Q \gt 0$) and $Q$ is coprime with $998,244,353$. You should compute $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $998,244,353$ for each of these values.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $L$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers â€• the answers corresponding to the probabilities that the value of the Boolean expression is '0', '1', 'a' or 'A' respectively.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 600$
- $1 \le |L| \le 100,000$
- $L$ contains only characters '#', '(', ')', '&', '|' and '^'
- the sum of $|L|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $|L| \le 300$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Output
```

```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The probabilities that the value of the expression is '0', '1', 'a' or 'A' are all equal to $1/4$.

**Example case 2:** There can be total 16 different expressions. Out of which :

For : (1&1)  ---&gt; $G_0 = G_1 = 1$, Probability for 1 = $1/16$ 

(a&1) , (1&a) , (a&a) ---&gt; $G_0 = 0$ and $G_1 = 1$, Probability for 'a' = $3/16$ 

(A&1) , (1&A) , (A&A) ----&gt; $G_0 = 1$ and $G_1 = 0$, Probability for 'A' = $3/16$

Rest all expressions have $G_0 = G_1 = 0$, Probability for '0' = $9/16$ 

Probability are expressed as mentioned in Problem Statement.
