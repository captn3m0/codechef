Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid $i$, elements $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$ are considered adjacent, and elements $A_1$ and $A_N$ are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either $1$ or $0$.

You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index $i$ such that $A_i = 1$ and move that $1$ to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change $A_i$ to $0$, choose one of the elements adjacent to $A_i$ and increment it by $1$.

According to Chef, a sequence is *good* if all its elements are different from $1$. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence $A$ into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of required operations, or $-1$ if it is impossible to make the sequence good.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $3 \le N \le 10^6$
- $0 \le A_i \le 1$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):**
- $N = 1,000$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
3
0 0 0
4
1 0 1 0
5
1 1 0 1 0
```

### Example Output
```
0
2
3
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The sequence is already good, so the answer is zero.

**Example case 2:** We can make the sequence good in two operations, e.g. $[1, 0, 1, 0] \rightarrow [0, 1, 1, 0] \rightarrow [0, 0, 2, 0]$.

**Example case 3:** We can make the sequence good in three operations, e.g. $[1, 1, 0, 1, 0] \rightarrow [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] \rightarrow [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] \rightarrow [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]$.
