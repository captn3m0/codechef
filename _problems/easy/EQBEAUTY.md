### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/mandarin/EQBEAUTY.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/russian/EQBEAUTY.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/vietnamese/EQBEAUTY.pdf) as well.

The **beauty** of an (non-empty) array of integers is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest element.
 
For example, the **beauty** of the array $[2,3,4,4,6]$ is $6 - 2 = 4$.

An array $A$ is said to be **good** if it is possible to partition the elements of $A$ into two non-empty arrays $B_1$ and $ B_2$  such that 
- $B_1$ and $ B_2$ have the same beauty.
- Each element of array $A$ should be in exactly one array: either in $B_1$ or in $B_2$.

For example, the array $[6, 2, 4, 4, 4]$ is good because its elements can be partitioned into two arrays $B_1 = [6, 4, 4]$ and $B_2 = [2, 4]$, where both $B_1$ and $B_2$ have the same beauty ($6-4 = 4-2 = 2$).  

You are given an array $A$ of length $N$. In one move you can:
- Select an index $i$ $(1\leq i \leq N)$ and either increase $A_i$ by $1$ or decrease $A_i$ by $1$.

Find the minimum number of moves required to make the array $A$ good.
