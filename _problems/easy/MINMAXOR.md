Chef's professor gave him homework to find a permutation of length $2^N$ such that each integer from $0$ to $2^N  - 1$ appears **exactly once** in the permutation and the maximum [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of any **even length** subarray is minimized. 

Chef wonders how many such permutations are there. Help Chef to find out the number of permutations modulo $(10^9 + 7)$, satisfying the above conditions and also help him find one such permutation.
