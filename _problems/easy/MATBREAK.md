You are given a square matrix $M$ with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered $1$ through $N$). Initially, all the elements of this matrix are equal to $A$. The matrix is broken down in $N$ steps (numbered $1$ through $N$); note that during this process, some elements of the matrix are simply marked as *removed*, but all elements are still indexed in the same way as in the original matrix. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th step consists of the following:
- Elements $M_{1, N-i+1}, M_{2, N-i+1}, \ldots, M_{i-1, N-i+1}$ are removed.
- Elements $M_{i, N-i+1}, M_{i, N-i+2}, \ldots, M_{i, N}$ are removed.
- Let's denote the product of all $2i-1$ elements removed in this step by $p_i$. Each of the remaining elements of the matrix (those which have not been removed yet) is multiplied by $p_i$.

Find the sum $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \ldots + p_N$. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $A$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the sum of products at each step modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 250$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le A \le 10^9$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Example Input
```
1
3 2
```

### Example Output
```
511620149
```
