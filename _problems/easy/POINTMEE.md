### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/bengali/POINTMEE.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/mandarin/POINTMEE.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/russian/POINTMEE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT21/vietnamese/POINTMEE.pdf) as well.

You are given $N$ *distinct* points in a $2$-D plane, numbered $1$ through $N$. The X-coordinate of the points are $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N$ respectively and the Y-coordinates are $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_N$ respectively. Your goal is to make the location of all the $N$ points equal to that of each other. To achieve this, you can do some operations.

In one operation, you choose an index $i\;(1 \leq i \leq N)$ and a **real number** $K$ and change the location of the $i^{th}$ point in one of the following ways:
- Set $(X_i, Y_i) = (X_i + K, Y_i)$
- Set $(X_i, Y_i) = (X_i, Y_i + K)$
- Set $(X_i, Y_i) = (X_i + K, Y_i + K)$
- Set $(X_i, Y_i) = (X_i + K, Y_i - K)$

Find the minimum number of operations to achieve the goal.
