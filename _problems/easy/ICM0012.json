So they decided on another option for the toss, before the match both the teams will be given a Competitive Programming Problem. The first team who solves the problem will have the right to choose whether to bat or field. In today's match following problem is given:- \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou are given a rectangular sheet of side lengths $N$ and $M$.

You can only cut from integer coordinates and all the available options for cuts are equally probable. Increment $T$ by $1$ and continue the process with the rectangle of larger area.\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou have to report the $E(T^2)$, the expected value of $T^2$.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction $\\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are positive integers and $Q$ is coprime with $998,244,353$.
