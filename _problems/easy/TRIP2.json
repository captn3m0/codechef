The trip takes place over the next $N$ days (numbered 1 through $N$). There are $K$ different places Chef and Chefu could visit (numbered 1 through $K$). They have written a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ which denotes the plan of the trip during these $N$ days; however, the plan is not completed yet. For each valid $i$, they want to visit the place $A_i$ on the $i$-th day, but if $A_i = -1$, then they haven't decided which place to visit on that day.\n\nChef and his friend do not want to visit the same place two days in a row, but they can visit a place more than once in total. It is not necessary to visit all the places during the trip. Determine whether it is possible to complete the plan in such a way that this condition is satisfied. If it is possible, find one way of completing the plan.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string `\"YES\"` if it's possible the complete the plan or `\"NO\"` otherwise.\n\nIf it's possible to complete the plan, print a second line containing $N$ space-separated integers denoting the sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ after completing the plan.
