All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV14/mandarin/RBTREE.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV14/russian/RBTREE.pdf).

Chef likes trees a lot. Today he has an infinte full binary tree (each node has exactly two childs) with special properties.
Chef's tree has the following special properties :

- Each node of the tree is either colored **red** or **black**.
- Root of the tree is **black** intially.
- Both childs of a **red** colored node are **black** and both childs of a **black** colored node are **red**.

The root of the tree is labelled as 1. For a node labelled **v**, it's left child is labelled as **2\*v** and it's right child is labelled as **2\*v+1**.

Chef wants to fulfill **Q** queries on this tree. Each query belongs to any of the following three types:

- **Qi** Change color of all **red** colored nodes to **black** and all **black** colored nodes to **red**.
- **Qb x y** Count the number of **black** colored nodes on the path from node **x** to node **y** (both inclusive).
- **Qr x y** Count the number of **red** colored nodes on the path from node **x** to node **y** (both inclusive).

Help chef accomplishing this task.


**Input**

First line of the input contains an integer **Q** denoting the number of queries. Next **Q** lines of the input contain **Q** queries (one per line). Each query belongs to one of the three types mentioned above.


**Output**

For each query of type **Qb** or **Qr**, print the required answer.


**Constraints**

**1. 1&lt;=Q&lt;=105** 
**1. 1&lt;=x,y&lt;=109** 


**Sample Input**

5
Qb 4 5
Qr 4 5
Qi
Qb 4 5
Qr 4 5


**Sample Output**

2
1
1
2


**Explanation**

With the initial configuration of the tree, Path from node 4 to node 5 is 4-&gt;2-&gt;5 and color of nodes on the path is B-&gt;R-&gt;B.

- Number of black nodes are 2.
- Number of red nodes are 1.

After Query Qi, New configuration of the path from node 4 to node 5 is R-&gt;B-&gt;R.

- Number of black nodes are 1.
- Number of red nodes are 2.



**Scoring**

- Subtask #1: **1&lt;=Q&lt;=100 1&lt;=x,y&lt;=1000** **: 27 pts**
- Subtask #2: **1&lt;=Q&lt;=103 1&lt;=x,y&lt;=105 : **25 pts****
- Subtask #3: **1&lt;=Q&lt;=105 1&lt;=x,y&lt;=109 : **48 pts****
