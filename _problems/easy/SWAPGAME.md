Chef is given two arrays $A$ and $B$, each having $N$ elements.

In one move, Chef can choose an index $i$ $(1 \leq i \leq N-1$), get $(A_i - A_{i+1})$ points, and then swap $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$.

**For example:** If Chef has the array - $[10, 7,5]$ and Chef chooses index $1$ during his move, he will get $10 - 7 = 3$ points and the new array will become $[7 , 10 ,5]$

Can you help Chef in finding the maximum number of points he can get while converting the array $A$ into array $B$?

$\textbf{Note:}$ It is guaranteed in the input that there exists a sequence of moves which can convert array $A$ into $B$.
