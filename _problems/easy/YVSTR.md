To make Yalalovichik even more satisfied and happy, Jafar decided to invent Yalalovichik strings. A string is called a Yalalovichik string if the set of all of its distinct non-empty substrings is equal to the set of all of its distinct non-empty subsequences. 

You are given a string $S$. You need to find the number of its distinct non-empty substrings which are Yalalovichik strings.

**Note:** A string $A$ is called a subsequence of a string $B$ if $A$ can be formed by erasing some characters (possibly none) from $B$. A string $A$ is called a substring of a string $B$ if it can be formed by erasing some characters (possibly none) from the beginning of $B$ and some (possibly none) from the end of $B$. Two substrings or subsequences are considered different if they are different strings.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N = |S|$.
- The second line contains the string $S$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of distinct Yalalovichik substrings of $S$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters

### Example Input
```
1
3
xxx
```

### Example Output
```
3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The distinct Yalalovichik substrings are "x", "xx" and "xxx".
