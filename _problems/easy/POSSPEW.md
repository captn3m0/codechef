A **circular array** of length $N$ is defined as follows: $N$ integers $A_1,A_2,â€¦,A_N$ are placed in a circle in such a way that for each $1 \leq i \lt N$, $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$ are adjacent, and $A_1$ and $A_N$ are also adjacent.

You are given a circular array $A$ of length $N$. At the end of each second, the following changes are executed in the array: If $A_i \gt 0$ then the elements which are adjacent to $A_i$, will get incremented by $1$, for all $1 \leq i \leq N$.

For example, consider the array $A = [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]$. 
- Initially $A_4$ and $A_8$ are greater than zero. So after one second, $A_3$, $A_5$, $A_1$ and $A_7$ will get incremented by $1$. Hence the array will become $A = [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5]$.

- After two seconds, the array becomes $A = [2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 7]$. Note that the value of $A_4$ has become $4$, because both, $A_3$ and $A_5$ were greater than zero after one second.

What will be the sum of elements present in the array $A$ after $K$ seconds?
