### Read problem statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/russian/THREEPTS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/mandarin/THREEPTS.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/bengali/THREEPTS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/START8/vietnamese/THREEPTS.pdf) as well.

There are three **distinct** points - $A, B, C$ in the $X-Y$ plane. Initially, you are located at point $A$. You want to reach the point $C$ satisfying the following conditions:
- You have to go through point B. 
- You can move in any of the four axis-parallel directions ($+X$, $-X$, $+Y$, $-Y$ direction). However, you can make **at most** one turn in the path from $A$ to $C$. 

Determine if it is possible to reach the destination $C$ satisfying the above conditions.

**NOTE**:  
- One turn means $90 ^ \circ$  clockwise or anticlockwise rotation along the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving towards the $+X$ direction, after one turn you can move either in the $+Y$ direction or in the $-Y$ direction. **Changing the direction by $180 ^ \circ$ is not allowed**.
