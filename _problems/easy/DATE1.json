Currently, it is time $0$, Chef just managed to light a candle, but he is out of matchsticks.\r\n\r\nSince Chef has an infinite supply of (unlit) candles, he can use the following strategy: each second (starting at time $0$), he takes one lit candle and lights up $X$ other candles using it. This process takes $1$ unit of time to complete, i.e. if Chef starts lighting up $X$ candles at a time $t_1$, he is able to finish at the time $t_1 + 1$.\r\n\r\nHowever, since candle wax is limited, a candle can only burn for $Y$ units of time and then it is extinguished.\r\n\r\nChef's girlfriend arrives at a time $A$ \u2014 specifically, after all the candles that were supposed to get extinguished at time $A$ have been extinguished and after Chef lights up all the candles that he was lighting up since time $A-1$. Now Chef wants to know the maximum number of candles which can be lit at the time $A$ to impress his girlfriend.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $A$, $Y$ and $X$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum number of lit candles Chef can impress his girlfriend with.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\r\n- $1 \\leq A, Y, X \\leq 10^9$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (40 points):** $A \\ge Y$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (60 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n3\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 2 1\r\n2 2 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** At the time $0$, there is one lit candle, using which we light $1$ more candle. At the time $1$, the starting candle gets extinguished and the candle which we started lighting up at the time $0$ is lit, so we have only $1$ candle lit up when Chef's girlfriend arrives.\r\n\r\n**Example case 2:** At the time $0$, there is one lit candle, using which we light $1$ more candle. At the time $1$, the candle which we started lighting up at the time $0$ and the starting candle are both lit.\r\n\r\n**Example case 3:** At the time $0$, there is one lit candle, using which we light $1$ more candle. At the time $1$, the candle which we started lighting up at time $0$ is lit, and we start lighting up one more candle. At the time $2$, the starting candle gets extinguished and the candle which we started lighting up at the time $1$ is lit. In total, we have $2$ lit candles when Chef's girlfriend arrives.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME94\/russian\/DATE1.pdf)\r\n\r\nChef is having a candlelit dinner with his girlfriend at his place.
