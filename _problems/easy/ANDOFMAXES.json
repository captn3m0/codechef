This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le K \\le N \\le 200000$\n- $0 \\le A_i \\le 10^9$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $200000$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/mandarin\/ANDOFMAXES.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/russian\/ANDOFMAXES.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/vietnamese\/ANDOFMAXES.pdf) as well.\n\nYou are given an array of $N$ integers $[A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N]$ and an integer $K \\le N$.
