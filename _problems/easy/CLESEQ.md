The ugliness of a sequence of size $N$ , whose elements are numbered from $1$ to $N$ , is defined as the number of instances such that neighboring elements are not equal to each other, that is, the ugliness of a sequence increase by $1$ if $a[i] \neq a[i-1]$ for $i \gt 1$.

Example: 
- $[1, 2, 2, 3]$, ugliness is $2$.
- $[2, 1, 2, 3,4]$, ugliness is $4$.

You are given a sequence of length $N$ consisting of the first $K$ natural numbers with each of the numbers occurs at least once in the sequence. For each $K$, you have to remove all its occurrences from the original sequence and determine the ugliness of the resulting sequence.


**Note**:  An empty sequence has ugliness of $0$.
