All submissions for this problem are available.Andriy and Serhiy are little students from the Lyceum of Kremenchuk. Yesterday there was a great party in the city - Chef's birthday. There were a lot of famous programmers at the party and, of course, everybody gave a gift to Chef. Andriy and Serhiy also didn't come empty-handed. Andriy gave Chef two integer numbers **N** and **K**. Serhiy was more inventive and gave Chef a strange function called "Random-Decreasing-Function", or "**RDF**" abbreviated. The function has the following form:

<pre>RDF(N, K)
    <b>for</b> i = 1 <b>to</b> K
        <b>do</b> N = random(N)
    <b>return</b> N
</pre>
In above language function **random(N)** returns any integer in the range **\[0, N)** with equal probability. Let's consider that **random(0) = 0**. Chef likes both gifts very much and he plays with them every day, let alone that he forgot about his restaurant. Chef runs this function plenty times a day. The only trouble is that results are too unexpected for Chef. Now he asks you to find the expected result of **RDF(N, K)**.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers **N** and **K**.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the expected result of **RDF(N, K)**. Your answer will be considered as correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than **10−6**. More formally if the expected output is **A** and your output is **B**, your output will be considered as correct if and only if
**|A − B| ≤ 10−6 \* max{|A|, |B|, 1}**.

### Constrains

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **500000** (**5 \* 105**)
- **1** ≤ **N** &lt; **100000** (**105**)
- 0 ≤ **K** &lt; **100000** (**105**)

### Example

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
6 1
4 2
4 3

<b>Output:</b>
2.5
0.3750
0.0416667
</pre>
### Explanation

**Example case 1.** **RDF(6, 1)** returns each of the numbers **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5** with probability **1/6**. Hence the expected value is
 **(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 6 = 2.5**.

**Example case 2.** Value of **N** when **RDF(4, 2)** is called may change by one of the following scenarios:

- **4 → 0 → 0** with probability **1/4**.
- **4 → 1 → 0** with probability **1/4**.
- **4 → 2 → 0** with probability **1/8**.
- **4 → 2 → 1** with probability **1/8**.
- **4 → 3 → 0** with probability **1/12**.
- **4 → 3 → 1** with probability **1/12**.
- **4 → 3 → 2** with probability **1/12**.

Hence the expected value is
 **0 \* 1/4 + 0 \* 1/4 + 0 \* 1/8 + 1 \* 1/8 + 0 \* 1/12 + 1 \* 1/12 + 2 \* 1/12 = 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/6 = 3/8 = 0.375**.

**Example case 3.** You should figure it out by yourself.
