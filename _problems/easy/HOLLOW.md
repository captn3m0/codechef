You are given a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.

You may perform the following operation up to $K$ times: choose two different cells and swap the values in them. Find the largest possible side length of a square subgrid which contains only '0'-s after performing these operations.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$, total number of testcases.
- Each testcase contains $N + 1$ lines of input.
- The first line contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of the grid.

### Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing one integer â€• the largest side length of a square subgrid containing only '0'-s.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2000$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 1000$
- $0 \leq K \leq N * M$
- Sum of $N * M$ over all tests is atmost $3*10^6$
- Each string contains only characters '0' and '1'

### Example Input
```
3
5 5 10
11111
10001
10001
10001
11111
3 7 1
1100110
1000111
1100011
3 7 2
1100110
1000111
1100011
```

### Example Output
```
3
2
3
```

### Explanation
**Case 1:** Since all the '0'-s in the grid already form a square with side length $3$, no swaps are required.

**Case 2:** If we could swap the values in pairs of cells $(0, 1)$, $(0, 6)$ and $(2, 1)$, $(2, 4)$, we would get a square with side length $3$ using $2$ swaps. But since the maximum possible number of swaps is $1$, the answer cannot be greater than $2$.

**Case 3:** We can swap the values in pairs of cells $(0, 1)$, $(0, 6)$ and $(2, 1)$, $(2, 4)$. Then, we get a square with side length $3$ using $2$ swaps.
