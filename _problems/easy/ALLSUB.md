### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/hindi/ALLSUB.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/bengali/ALLSUB.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/mandarin/ALLSUB.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/russian/ALLSUB.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME76/vietnamese/ALLSUB.pdf) as well.

You are given two strings $S$ and $R$. You may reorder the characters in the string $R$ in any way; let's denote the resulting string by $R_r$. This reordered string is *valid* if it contains all substrings of $S$, i.e. for each substring $s$ of $S$ (including $S$ itself), $R_r$ contains $s$ as a substring.

Find the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string or determine that there is no such valid string.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $S$.
- The second line contains a single string $R$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string â€” the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string, or `"Impossible"` if there is no such string.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le |S|, |R| \le 10^5$
- $S$ and $R$ contain only lowercase English letters
- the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$
- the sum of $|R|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):**
- $1 \le |S|, |R| \le 1,000$
- $S$ and $R$ contain only the characters 'a' and 'b'
- the sum of $|S|$ in all test cases does not exceed $10^4$
- the sum of $|R|$ in all test cases does not exceed $10^4$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```

### Example Output
