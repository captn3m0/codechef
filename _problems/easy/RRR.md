A [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament) tournament is being held in Chefland among N teams numbered $1,2,...,N$. Every team play with all other teams $\textbf{exactly}$ once. All games have only two possible results - win or loss. A win yields $2$ points to the winning team while a loss yields no points. What is the maximum number of points a team finishing at the $K^{th}$ position can score?

$\textbf{Note:}$ If two teams have the same points then the team with the higher team number achieves the better rank.
