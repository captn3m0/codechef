### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/KMAX2.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/KMAX2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/KMAX2.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and an integer $K$. Find the number of contiguous subsequences $A_L, A_{L+1}, \ldots, A_R$ such that $R-L+1 \ge K$ and the $K$-th element of the subsequence ($A_{L+K-1}$) is equal to the maximum of all elements of the entire sequence.
