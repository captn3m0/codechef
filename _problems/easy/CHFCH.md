Chef's brother Chefu is a competitive programmer. Every day, he practices for ICPC (International Chefs' Programming Contest) by solving problems. Today, Chef challenged his brother to solve a certain problem, promising to bake an apple pie for him if he succeeds. Chefu has successfully solved the problem, but can you solve it? 

You are given an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. In one move, you must select two adjacent elements of this sequence (i.e. $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$ for some valid $i$) and swap them. Let's call a sequence *orderly* if it contains a **contiguous** subsequence with length at least $K$ such that all of its elements have identical values. Find the minimum number of moves required to make the given sequence orderly or determine that it is impossible.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of moves, or $-1$ if it is impossible to make the sequence orderly.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $2 \le K \le N \le 300,000$
- $1 \le A_i \le 300,000$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):**
- $N \le 100$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,000$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
8 3
1 2 2 1 3 3 2 1
5 3
1 1 2 2 3
```

### Example Output
```

-1
```
