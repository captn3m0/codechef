You are given two points $P$ and $Q$ and an opaque sphere in a three-dimensional space. The point $P$ is not moving, while $Q$ is moving in a straight line with constant velocity. You are also given a direction vector $d$ with the following meaning: the position of $Q$ at time $t$ is $Q(t) = Q(0) + d \cdot t$, where $Q(0)$ is the initial position of $Q$.

It is guaranteed that $Q$ is not visible from $P$ initially (at time $t=0$). It is also guaranteed that $P$ and $Q$ do not touch the sphere at any time.

Find the smallest positive time $t_v$ when $Q$ is visible from $P$, i.e. when the line segment connecting points $P$ and $Q$ does not intersect the sphere.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains 13 space-separated integers.
    - The first three integers $P_x, P_y, P_z$ denote the coordinates of $P$.
    - The next three integers $Q_x, Q_y, Q_z$ denote the initial coordinates of $Q$.
    - The next three integers $d_x, d_y, d_z$ denote the components of the direction vector $d$.
    - The last four integers $c_x, c_y, c_z, r$ denote the coordinates of the centre of the sphere and its radius.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number â€” the time $t_v$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. It is guaranteed that $t_v$ exists and does not exceed $10^9$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- the absolute values of coordinates of all points do not exceed $2\cdot10^9$
- $1 \le r \le 10^9$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (25 points):** $P_z = Q_z = d_z = c_z = 0$

**Subtask #2 (75 points):** original constraints
