Everything was going well in Wasseypur until Ramadhir Singh came to know that Sahid Khan plans to kill him someday, and takeover his mine. So he decided to take preemptive measures and kill Sahid Khan first. However Sahid Khan also came to know Ramadhir Singh's plan to kill him soon. Wasseypur was all set for bloodshed but the Chef intervened. Instead of violence, he convinced both to play a game called Game of Wasseypur.

There is a string $S$ of length $N$ consisting of only $0's$ and $1's$. The Game is played in turns, in each turn a player can erase a $block$ from the current string and the remaining part of the string will concatenate to make the current string for another player.

A block in the string is defined as a non-empty substring consisting of the same character such that both the neighbouring character(s) (if exists) are different from the character of the substring. $Eg: S = “0001110110011”$
In the above string, there are $6$ blocks which are $000,111,0,11,00,11$

The player who will not be able to make a move at the end will lose the game and so will have to leave the Wasseypur. Both Sahid Khan and Ramadhir have taken the help of Wasseypur's elders and will play optimally. Assuming the game will start from the Sahid khan, find out the winner.
