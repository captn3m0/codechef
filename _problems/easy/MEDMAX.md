You have an $n \times n$ matrix $a$. You can rearrange the elements of the matrix in any way. Let $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n$ be the medians of each row in $a$ after the rearrangement. The goodness of the matrix $a$ is defined as $\min(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n)$. Naturally, rearranging values also comes with a cost. The cost of rearrangement is defined as $m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_n$. 
<br><br>
Find the $\textbf{max goodness}$ you can achieve after rearranging a matrix $a$ such that the cost of rearrangement doesn't exceed $k$ or $-1$ if the answer doesn't exist.
<br><br>
The median of an array $a$ consisting of $n$ elements is the $\lceil{\frac{n+1}{2}}\rceil^{th}$ largest element of $a$. The median of $[4, 8, 6, 1]$ is $6$ and the median of $[1, 6, 2, 4, 5]$ is $4$.
