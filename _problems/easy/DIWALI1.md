Chef has allocated himself a budget of $P$ rupees to buy Diwali crackers. There are only $3$ types of crackers available in the market and each type of cracker can be bought any number of times.

1. Fuljhari, where each costs $a$ rupees
2. Anar, where each costs $b$ rupees
3. Chakri, where each costs $c$ rupees

The crackers have the following interesting properties:-
- A Fuljhari can be lit on its own 
- To light an Anar, you will need $x$ Fuljharis
- To light a Chakri, you will need $y$ Fuljharis

What's the maximum total of Anars and Chakris that Chef can light up with his given budget.
