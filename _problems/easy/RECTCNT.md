<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Given N separate integer points on the Cartesian plane satisfying: there is no any three of them sharing a same X-coordinate. Your task is to count the number of rectangles (whose edges parrallel to the axes) created from any four of given points.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are several test cases (ten at most), each formed as follows:
<ul>
<li>The first line contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤ 10<sup>5</sup>).</li>
<li>N lines follow, each containing a pair of integers (each having an absolute value of 10<sup>9</sup> at most) describing coordinates of a given point.</li>
</ul>
The input is ended with N = 0.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective number of rectangles found.
</p>
