Samosa Bhai got tired of the difficult tasks given by CodeChef along with meagre salary being paid to him. So he moves to Aloo uncle's village and opens a courier company there. In the village, everyone knows Aloo uncle and Kachori Aunty, so everyone sends their gifts using Samosa Bhai's courier company only.</p>
<p>
There are <b>N</b> houses in a row in the village. On New Year's Eve, each house sends a gift to all the other houses.<br />
The distance between two houses situated at positions <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> in the row is <b>|x - y|</b>. Samosa Bhai's courier company charges <b>d<sup>k</sup></b> rupees for each delivery, where <b>d</b> is the distance between the 2 houses. </p>
<p>
Everyone chose Samosa Bhai's company because of Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty. So he decides to give them the amount of money earned by him modulo <b>1000000007 (10<sup>9</sup> + 7)</b>. You need to compute this amount.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>
<li>The first line of each test case contains 2 integers &mdash; <b>N</b> and <b>k</b> &mdash; denoting the number of houses and the exponent <b>k</b>, resepctively. The second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>2</sub></b>, &hellip; , <b>A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the positions of the houses. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>
<li>For each test case, output a single line with the amount given to Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty by Samosa Bhai.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>
<li><b>2</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>
<li><b>0</b> ≤ <b>k</b> ≤ <b>100</b></li>
<li><b>0</b> ≤ <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ <b>1000000006</b></li>
<li>The sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases will be at most <b>100000</b></li>
<li>2 houses <b>can</b> be at the same position</li>
</ul>

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><b>Example case 1.</b> House 1 sends a gift to House 2 with cost (|2 - 7|)<sup>2</sup> and house 2 sends a gift to house 1 with cost (|7-2|)<sup>2</sup>, for a total cost of 50</p>
<p><b>Example case 3.</b> The cost for gift from house with index 1 to house with index 2 is 2<sup>2</sup> = 4, from houses 1 to 3 is 1, from houses 2 to 3 is 1. Taking into account the gifts sent the other way (from 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 3 to 2), the total cost is 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12</p>
