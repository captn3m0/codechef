All submissions for this problem are available.Kira likes to play with strings very much. Moreover he likes the shape of 'W' very much. He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them *W strings*.

For example, the *W string* can be formed from "aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd" such as:

<pre><pre class="text-monospace" style="font-family: Courier, 'Courier New', monospace">
    a
     a             d
      a     #     d
       a   b c   d
        a b   c d
         #     #
</pre>
He also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) *W strings*.

More formally, a string **S** is a *W string* if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in **Note**, please see it if you cannot understand):

- The string **S** contains **exactly** **3** '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be **P1 &lt; P2 &lt; P3** (indexes are 0-origin).
- Each substring of **S\[0, P1−1\], S\[P1+1, P2−1\], S\[P2+1, P3−1\], S\[P3+1, |S|−1\]** contains exactly one kind of characters, where **S\[a, b\]** denotes the non-empty substring from **a+1**th character to **b+1**th character, and **|S|** denotes the length of string **S** (See **Note** for details).

Now, his friend Ryuk gives him a string **S** and asks him to find the length of the longest *W string* which is a subsequence of **S**, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the "positions" we are looking at are in **S**), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the *W string* are **P1, P2, P3** (in increasing order) in the original string **S**, then there must be no index **i** such that **S\[i\]** = '#' where **P1 &lt; i &lt; P2 or P2 &lt; i &lt; P3**.

Help Kira and he won't write your name in the **Death Note**.

**Note**:

For a given string **S**, let **S\[k\]** denote the **k+1**th character of string **S**, and let the index of the character **S\[k\]** be **k**. Let **|S|** denote the length of the string **S**. And a substring of a string **S** is a string **S\[a, b\] = S\[a\] S\[a+1\] ... S\[b\]**, where **0 ≤ a ≤ b &lt; |S|**. And a subsequence of a string **S** is a string **S\[i0\] S\[i1\] ... S\[in−1\]**, where **0 ≤ i0 &lt; i1 &lt; ... &lt; in−1 &lt; |S|**.

For example, let **S** be the string "kira", then **S\[0\]** = 'k', **S\[1\]** = 'i', **S\[3\]** = 'a', and **|S| = 4**. All of **S\[0, 2\]** = "kir", **S\[1, 1\]** = "i", and **S\[0, 3\]** = "kira" are substrings of **S**, but "ik", "kr", and "arik" are not. All of "k", "kr", "kira", "kia" are subsequences of **S**, but "ik", "kk" are not.

From the above definition of *W string*, for example, "a#b#c#d", "aaa#yyy#aaa#yy", and "o#oo#ooo#oooo" are *W string*, but "a#b#c#d#e", "#a#a#a", and "aa##a#a" are not.

### Input

First line of input contains an integer **T**, denoting the number of test cases. Then **T** lines follow. Each line contains a string **S**.

### Output

Output an integer, denoting the length of the longest *W string* as explained before. If **S** has no *W string* as its subsequence, then output 0.

### Constraints

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 100**
- **1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 (104)**
- **S** contains no characters other than lower English characters ('a' to 'z') and '#' (without quotes)

### Example

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd
acb#aab#bab#accba
abc#dda#bb#bb#aca

<b>Output:</b>
16
10
11
</pre>
### Explanation

In the first case: the whole string forms a *W String*.

In the second case: acb#aab#bab#accba, the longest *W string* is ac**b#aa**b**\#b**a**b#a**ccb**a**

In the third case: abc#dda#bb#bb#aca, note that even though **a**bc**\#dd**a**\#bb**\#**bb#a**c**a** (boldened characters form the subsequence) is a *W string* of length **12**, it violates Ryuk's condition that there should not be any #'s inbetween the **3** chosen # positions. One correct string of length **11** is **a**bc#dd**a#bb#bb#a**c**a**
