As the cost of petrol is increasing day by day he decided to build a water car to take his girlfriend Natasha on a date. Water Car has great build quality but is able to travel only $1$ Km on every $1$ liter of water. To show off his Water Car to Natasha he took her to the formula racing track which is an ($N-1$) km long road with checkpoints numbered $1$ to $N$. Initially, Chef is at checkpoint number $1$. At every checkpoint, there is a Water station but the cost of filling $1$ litre of water at a checkpoint is equal to the checkpoint number. You cannot store more than $V$ litres of water in the tank of a car. Chef is interested in the both minimum as well as maximum cost of filling that can happen to reach the checkpoint number $N$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le T \\le 10^3$\n- $1 \\le N, V \\le 10^9$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (20 points):** $V = 1$\n\n**Subtask 2 (80 points):** Original constraints\n\n\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/mandarin\/CHEFCAR.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/russian\/CHEFCAR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/vietnamese\/CHEFCAR.pdf) as well.\n\nChef is a great mechanic. As the cost of petrol is increasing day by day he decided to build a water car to take his girlfriend Natasha on a date. Water car has great build quality but is able to travel only $1$ Km on every $1$ liter of water. To show off his water car to Natasha he took her to the formula racing track which is an ($N-1$) km long road with checkpoints numbered $1$ to $N$ from left to right. The distance between two adjacent checkpoints is $1$ Km.\n\nInitially, Chef is at checkpoint number $1$ and the tank of the water car is empty. At every checkpoint, there is a water station, but the cost of filling $1$ liter of water at a checkpoint is equal to the checkpoint number. Chef can not store more than $V$ liters of water in the tank of a car. Chef is interested in both minimum as well as the maximum cost of filling that can happen to reach the checkpoint number $N$.\n\nYou shouldn't have any water left after reaching $N^{th}$ checkpoint. Also, you are not allowed to pour out water.","inputFormat":"- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

There is no other way to reach the destination with a different expense.\n","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"iamakshat01","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>iamakshat01<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"20-10-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy'>easy<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/iamakshat01'>iamakshat01<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime101'>ltime101<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/math'>math<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Simple","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CHEFCAR","time":{"view_start_date":1635354000,"submit_start_date":1635354000,"visible_start_date":1635354000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797780},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=CHEFCAR","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
