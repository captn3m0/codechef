### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/bengali/MEXOR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/mandarin/MEXOR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/russian/MEXOR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT21/vietnamese/MEXOR.pdf) as well.

The *MEX* (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

- The MEX of $[2, 2, 1]$ is $0$, because $0$ does not belong to the array.
- The MEX of $[3, 1, 0, 1]$ is $2$, because $0$ and $1$ belong to the array, but $2$ does not.
- The MEX of $[0, 3, 1, 2]$ is 4 because $0, 1, 2$ and $3$ belong to the array, but $4$ does not.

Find the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) of the elements in the array does not exceed $X$.
