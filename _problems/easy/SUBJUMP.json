This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $ 1 \\le T \\le 2500 $ - the number of test cases\n- $ 1 \\le N \\le 10^5 $ - the number of stones.\n- $ 1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9 $ - the number written on stones.\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^{5} $","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (5 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 10, 1 \\le A_i \\le 100, \\sum N \\le 50$\n- **Subtask 2 (10 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 100, 1 \\le A_i \\le 100, \\sum N \\le 500$\n- **Subtask 3 (15 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 1000, \\sum N \\le 5000$\n- **Subtask 4 (70 points):** original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"There are $N$ stones in a pond, each having a value $A_i$ written on it.
