The problem is Ron really love coding and he doesn't care about other stuff. This course even gives him<br \/>\nmore stress. However, like it or not Ron still need to try his best not to let this course ruins his great GPA.<br \/>\nCan you help him with his first assignment which is described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn this assignment, Ron is given an <b>N<\/b>\u00d7<b>N<\/b> pixels image called sample image. Ron is required to create a copy of the<br \/>\nsample image using an simple graphic painting program called SMPaint. Only two types of operation can be used in SMPaint:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Init: Make the new image with the specific size, all the pixels of the new image are white.<\/li>\n<li>Paint: User gives 5 integers <b>C<\/b>, <b>U<\/b>, <b>D<\/b>, <b>L<\/b>, <b>R<\/b> and SMPaint will change colour to <b>C<\/b> at all the pixels (<b>x<\/b>, <b>y<\/b>) such that (<b>U<\/b> \u2264 <b>x<\/b> \u2264 <b>D<\/b> and <b>L<\/b> \u2264 <b>y<\/b> \u2264 <b>R<\/b>).<br \/>\nThe pixel (<b>x<\/b>, <b>y<\/b>) is the pixel at the <b>xth<\/b> row (from the top, 1-indexed) and the <b>yth<\/b> column (from the left side, 1-indexed).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/tinypic.com?ref=33wa5wo\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i40.tinypic.com\/33wa5wo.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\nWe can see that the Paint operation actually is painting a specific rectangle in the image by one specific colour.<br \/>\nThe image in the <b>figure 1<\/b> can be drawn using 3 calls of the second function if we paint the red rectangle first and then paint two<br \/>\ngreen rectangles. Notice that if a pixel is changed colour several time, it final colour is corresponding to the last time it is painted.<br \/>\nThis help us save some calls of the second function. For the image in figure 1 we can paint a large green rectangle first and then paint the red rectangle.<br \/>\nYour mission is help Ron finish the assignment with using as least as possible number of calls of the second function.\n<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains integer <b>N<\/b>. Each of the next <b>N<\/b> lines contains <b>N<\/b> integers. The <b>yth<\/b> number in the <b>xth<\/b> line<br \/>\nrepresent the colour of the pixel (<b>x<\/b>, <b>y<\/b>) in the sample image.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the output must contain integer <b>M<\/b> that is the number of calls of the second function you need.<br \/>\nThe next <b>M<\/b> lines represent the calls to the second function in chronological order.<br \/>\nEach line must contain 5 integers which are the values (they must be in this order) <b>C<\/b>, <b>U<\/b>, <b>D<\/b>, <b>L<\/b>, <b>R<\/b> for the corresponding call. The following conditions must be held:<br \/>\n<lu><\/lu><\/p>\n<li><b>0<\/b> \u2264 <b>C<\/b> \u2264 <b>100<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>U<\/b> \u2264 <b>D<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>L<\/b> \u2264 <b>R<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b><\/li>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 <b>1000<\/b><\/li>\n<li>The colours are represented by integers from <b>0<\/b> to <b>100<\/b> where <b>0<\/b> means white colour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n1 2 4 2 4\n2 2 4 3 3\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3> Scoring &amp; the test data generation <\/h3>\n<p>\nYour solution will not get point if it performs more than <b>N<sup>2<\/sup><\/b> Paint operations or the final image is different<br \/>\nwith the sample one.

Smaller score means your solution is better. <br \/> <br \/><\/p>\n<p>The test data is generated randomly by simulating the process of making an image in SMPaint using no more than <b>500<\/b> Paint operations.

You must correctly solve all test files to receive OK.<br \/>\nDuring the contest, your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first 7 test files.<br \/>\nAfter the contest, all solutions will be rescored by the sum of the scores on the rest 18 test files.<br \/>\nNote, that public part of the tests can not contain some border cases.
