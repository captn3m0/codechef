The junctions are numbered from <b>1<\/b> to <b>N<\/b> inclusive. For each road the time required to pass it is known.<\/p>\n<p>There's a shop in every junction. Each shop contains some of <b>K<\/b> types of goods.

Please note that buying goods take negligible time, so buying goods and switching roads can be considered instantaneous. Also, passing through junctions and roads multiple times is allowed. Also, note that you are also allowed to pass through junction <b>N<\/b> also, as long as in the end, you end up at this junction.<\/p>\n<p>The penalty is defined as the sum of <b>T<sub>i<\/sub> * W<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> over all types of goods, where <b>T<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> denotes the time between the moment of the purchase of the item of the goods of the <b>i<\/b><sup>th<\/sup> type and the finish moment.

So we buy goods of the type <b>1<\/b>, and spend <b>13<\/b> rubles.<\/li>\n<li>Command <b>-2<\/b> means to buy goods of the type <b>2<\/b>. So we buy goods of the type <b>2<\/b> and spend <b>15<\/b> burles.

Meanwhile, the penalty becomes equal to <b>(50 + 91) * 38 = 5358<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li>Command <b>4<\/b> means to move to the fourth junction. The penalty function becomes equal to <b>(50 + 91) * (38 + 18) = 7896<\/b>.
