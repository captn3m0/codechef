For each valid $i$, the position of the $i$-th city is $(X_i, Y_i)$. Also, for each valid $i$, the $i$-th wire is a line segment with endpoints $(A_i, B_i)$ and $(C_i, D_i)$ initially.\r\n\r\nIn order to transmit power, Ada built two plates (line segments): the *positive plate*, which has endpoints $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$, and the *negative plate*, which has endpoints $(10^6+1, 10^6)$ and $(10^6, 10^6 + 1)$.\r\n\r\nA wire is *positive* if it intersects the positive plate or intersects another wire about which we already know that it is positive. Similarly, a wire is *negative* if it intersects the negative plate or another negative wire. It is not allowed for any wire to be both positive and negative, because that creates a short-circuit.\r\n\r\nFor each valid $i$, let $S_i$ be the minimum of distances of the $i$-th city from endpoints of positive wires, and let $T_i$ be the minimum of its distances from endpoints of negative wires. Then, the cost of transmitting electricity to the $i$-th city is $S_i^2 + T_i^2$. Let $P$ be the sum of these costs over all cities.\r\n\r\nYou are allowed to move the wires, but not to rotate them. For each valid $i$, the cost of moving the $i$-th segment by $h_i$ units horizontally and $v_i$ units vertically from its original position is $h_i^2 + v_i^2$. After such a move, the endpoints of the segment become $(A_i + h_i, B_i + v_i)$ and $(C_i + h_i,  D_i + v_i)$. Let $Q$ be the sum of costs of moving all the wires.\r\n\r\nYour goal is to move the wires and make $P + Q$ as small as possible. In the final network of wires, there should be at least one positive wire, at least one negative wire, and no wire should be both positive and negative. However, it is allowed to have some wires that are neither positive nor negative.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\r\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$.\r\n- $M$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains four space-separated integers $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$ and $D_i$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nPrint $M$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers $h_i$ and $v_i$ denoting that the $i$-th wire is moved by $h_i$ ($|h_i| \\leq 10^6$) units horizontally and by $v_i$ ($|v_i| \\leq 10^6$) units vertically.\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n4 4\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 3\r\n4 4\r\n0 0 4 2\r\n3 5 4 2\r\n4 5 2 4\r\n1 5 3 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n-1 0\r\n-1 0\r\n-1 1\r\n2 0\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n### Explanation\r\nThe following figure shows the cities $\\mathsf{A}$, $\\mathsf{B}$, $\\mathsf{C}$ and $\\mathsf{D}$, the positive plate $\\mathsf{EF}$, negative plate $\\mathsf{GH}$ and the wires $\\mathsf{IJ}$, $\\mathsf{KL}$, $\\mathsf{MN}$ and $\\mathsf{OP}$.

In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files.
