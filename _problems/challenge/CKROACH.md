There are the big enemies for all chefs, that is, <i>G</i>s (the plural form of <i>G</i>).
Chef Ciel find <strong>N</strong> Gs in her restaurant.
Ciel is very scared, and she is going to kill the Gs by using insecticides.
Here <strong>M</strong> insecticides are available,
and the price of the <strong>j</strong>-th insecticide is <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong>, and she can use the <strong>j</strong>-th insecticide for all <strong>N</strong> Gs if she buys it.
Unfortunately Gs may have resistance to insecticides, so Gs may be still alive after using some insecticides.
But we know that if Ciel use the <strong>j</strong>-th insecticide, the <strong>i</strong>-th G will be dead with the probability <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub>%, and these are statistically independent.
</p>

<p>
Chef Ciel would like to buy some insecticides, and then, Ciel may use the insecticides one by one.
Ciel hopes that the <strong>i</strong>-th G will be dead with a probability at least 90%, for all <strong>i</strong>, after using all insecticides which she buys.
</p>

<p>
Your work is selecting a cheaper (cheapest is not necessary) set of distinct insecticides which she buys.
Don't forget that the set must kill the <strong>i</strong>-th G with a probability at least 90% for all <strong>i</strong>.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases.
Then <strong>T</strong> test cases follow.
The first line for each test case has 2 integers <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong>.
The next line has <strong>M</strong> integers <strong>C</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>C</strong><sub>2</sub>, ..., <strong>C<sub>M</sub></strong>.
Then next <strong>N</strong> lines have <strong>M</strong> integers <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub>, that is the <strong>j</strong>-th integer of the <strong>i</strong>-th line.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case, you should print two lines.
The first line should have an integer <strong>K</strong>, the number of insecticides which Ciel buys.
The second line should have <strong>K</strong> integers, the numbers of insecticides which Ciel buys, in ascending order.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
<strong>T</strong> = 50 (except for Sample Input)<br />
50 &le; <strong>N</strong> &le; 200 (except for Sample Input)<br />
50 &le; <strong>M</strong> &le; 200 (except for Sample Input)<br />
1 &le; <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> &le; 1000000 (10<sup>6</sup>)<br />
0 &le; <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub> &le; 90<br />
The probability of killing the <strong>i</strong>-th G is at least 90% for all <strong>i</strong>, if Ciel buys all insecticides.<br />
</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>
For each test case, the score is defined as (<strong>basic</strong> - <strong>your</strong>) / <strong>basic</strong>, where <strong>your</strong> is the cost of your set and <strong>basic</strong> is the cost of the set given by <a href="http://www.codechef.com/download/CKROACH_simplesolution.c">CKROACH_simplesolution.c</a>.
If the score is negative, it is treated as 0.
Your objective is to maximize the total score.
</p>


<h3>Test Case Generation</h3>
<p>
There is only one input file for this problem. Each test case generated by the below method.
</p>

<p>
<strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> and <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub> are chosen uniformly at random such that they satisfy constraints.
After that, each <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub> becomes 0 with the probability 0.75.
Then an integer <strong>x</strong> is chosen from the set {1, 2, 5, 10, 100} uniformly at random.
For each <strong>j</strong> (1 &le; <strong>j</strong> &le; <strong>M</strong>), 
a real number <strong>y</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub> is chosen from [0, 1) uniformly at random, 
and <strong>C</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub> is set at (<strong>x</strong> + <strong>y</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub>) * (<strong>P</strong><sub>1,<strong>j</strong></sub> + <strong>P</strong><sub>2,<strong>j</strong></sub> + ... + <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>N</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub>) rounded to the nearest integer.
If <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> is less than 1, then <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> becomes 1.
If <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> is more than 1000000, then <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> becomes 1000000.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if the generated case does not satisfy the constraint "The probability of killing the <strong>i</strong>-th G is at least 90% for all <strong>i</strong>, if Ciel buys all insecticides", this case is destroyed and do the above process once again.

<h3>Output details</h3>
<p>
In the first case, the third insecticide will kill the <strong>i</strong>-th G with probability 90% for all <strong>i</strong>.
</p>
<p>
In the second case, after using the third and fifth insecticides,
G is still alive with the probability (1 - 40/100) * (1 - 85/100) = 0.6 * 0.15 = 0.09.
Therefore the set of the third and fifth insecticides will kill the G with the probability 91%.
