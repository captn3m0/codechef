{"category_name":"challenge","status":"success","problem_code":"EFFPAINT","problem_name":"Efficient Painting","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p>Chef recently took up painting. He likes painting pictures, but is always thinking of ways to make painting more efficient. Chef begins with a square canvas, initially painted completely white. He paints one rectangle at a time, where every edge must have integer length, and 2 edges of the rectangle must be parallel to the horizontal axis. When Chef paints a rectangle, he paints it in one of the following ways:\n<ul>\n<li>White - paint the entire rectangle white<\/li>\n<li>Black - paint the entire rectangle black<\/li>\n<li>Flip - All white paint inside the rectangle becomes black, and all black paint becomes white<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<p>Chef wants your help in order to paint as few rectangles as possible. You will be given the final picture that Chef intends to paint.  You must come up with a plan to paint the picture. Chef knows this is a difficult problem, so he isn't requiring optimal solutions, but the fewer rectangles you use the more points you will score.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>Input will begin with an integer <b>N<\/b>, the size of the painting. <b>N<\/b> lines follow with <b>N<\/b> characters each, describing the picture chef wishes to paint. The top-left corner is <b>(0, 0)<\/b>, the top-right corner is <b>(0, N\u22121)<\/b>, the bottom-left corner is <b>(N\u22121, 0)<\/b>, and the bottom-right corner is <b>(N\u22121, N-1)<\/b>. A 'W' character indicates the corresponding cell of the painting is white, and a 'B' character indicates the cell is black.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>First output an integer <b>L<\/b>, the number of rectangles in your solution. This number must not exceed <b>N<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>. Then output <b>L<\/b> lines. Each line should consist of 2 pairs of integers followed by a 'W', 'B', or 'F' character. The first pair of integers is the <b>(row, column)<\/b> coordinates of the upper-left corner of the rectangle, and the second pair is the <b>(row, column)<\/b> coordinates of the bottom-right corner. The final character indicates the operation to perform on the rectangle, 'W' for white, 'B' for black, and 'F' for flip.<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p><b>10 \u2264 N \u2264 50<\/b> (excepting Sample Input)<br \/>All official inputs are generated by the method described in Test Generation.<\/p>\n<h3>Scoring<\/h3>\n<p>Your score for each test file is <b>10*L\/N<sup>2<\/sup><\/b>. Your overall score is the average of your scores on the individual test files. The goal is to minimize your score.<\/p>\n<h3>Sample Input<\/h3>\n<pre><code>5\nBWBBB\nBBBWW\nBBWWB\nBBWWB\nWBBBW\n<\/code><\/pre><h3>Sample Output<\/h3>\n<pre>5\n0 0 3 4 B\n2 2 4 3 F\n4 1 4 1 B\n0 1 0 1 W\n1 3 1 4 W\n<\/pre><h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>The painting of the grid proceeds as follows:<\/p>\n<pre><code>WWWWW\nWWWWW\nWWWWW\nWWWWW\nWWWWW\n\n<b>BBBBB<\/b>\n<b>BBBBB<\/b>\n<b>BBBBB<\/b>\n<b>BBBBB<\/b>\nWWWWW\n\nBBBBB\nBBBBB\nBB<b>WW<\/b>B\nBB<b>WW<\/b>B\nWW<b>BB<\/b>W\n\nBBBBB\nBBBBB\nBBWWB\nBBWWB\nW<b>B<\/b>BBW\n\nB<b>W<\/b>BBB\nBBBBB\nBBWWB\nBBWWB\nWBBBW\n\nBWBBB\nBBB<b>WW<\/b>\nBBWWB\nBBWWB\nWBBBW\n<\/code><\/pre><p>This sample output would score <b>10*5\/5<sup>2<\/sup> = 2<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3>Test Generation<\/h3>\n<p>We have <b>50<\/b> official test cases, each of them is created as follows:<\/p>\n<p>An integer <b>N<\/b> is chosen from <b>[10, 50]<\/b> uniformly at random.
