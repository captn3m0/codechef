This year, after Santa finished delivering all the presents, he realized that he used last year\u2019s list. Now he starts thinking about how he could fix this.\nWe know that\n<ul>\n<li>Santa has an infinite amount of every kind of present at home<\/li>\n<li>Santa's reindeer can fly, so he doesn't need roads<\/li>\n<li>Santa has a bag which has a maximum capacity; this capacity is given<\/li>\n<li>Santa can leave an infinite amount of presents at every child's house at any moment except the end<\/li>\n<li>At the end, the Santa has to go to his house, and every house should contain just the present the child from this house wished for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>Santa would like to minimize the total distance that he needs to travel to fix things.

Your total score will be the sum of your scores over all the test cases in all the test files. There will be 10 official test files. During the contest you will be able to get your score on the first 2 test files. After the contest the score for the full test set will be shown.\n\n<h3>Test Case Generation<\/h3>\nWhen we say a number is chosen from <b>(a,b)<\/b>, it means an integer number chosen randomly and uniformly between <b>a<\/b> and <b>b<\/b> inclusive.\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>T<\/b> is <b>3<\/b> (except sample)<\/li>\n<li><b>N<\/b> is <b>500<\/b> <\/li>\n<li><b>G<\/b> is chosen from <b>(10, 50)<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>B<\/b> is chosen from <b>(50, 200)<\/b><\/li>\n<li>Every coordinate is chosen uniquely from <b>(0, 10000)<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li>We choose a <b>minP<\/b> from <b>(1, 5)<\/b>, and <b>maxP<\/b> from <b>(5, 20)<\/b>.
