Dima also has a set of <b>N<\/b> circles. Sereja can easily recognise his set of circles because he has built the circles himself using strong steel wire. One day, Dima put his <b>N<\/b> circles into Sereja's circles and shuffled all the circles here and there. You are given this information about the circles by <b>2 * N<\/b> integers corresponding to the radiuses of the circles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, Sereja wants to provide you details about his circles in the form of interactive queries, <b>i<\/b>-th of which will denote the radius of <b>i<\/b>-th of his circles. For each query, you have to position a circle of this radius in 2-D plane by providing the coordinates of its center <b>(x, y)<\/b>, such that <b>(r \u2264 X, Y \u2264 S - r)<\/b>. \n\n<p>Your aim is to position the Sereja's circles in the way so as to minimum distance between each pair of circles is as large as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sereja is a generous person, so he will allow you to skip placing circles at most <b>skip<\/b> times of his queries.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input + Output<\/h3>\n<p>First line will contain three space separated integers <b>N, S, skip<\/b>. Next line contains <b>2*N<\/b> numbers written on the sheet of paper.<\/p>\n<p>After this you will be given <b>N<\/b> queries. The <b>i<\/b>-th of the query will contain an integer <b>r<\/b> denoting the radius of Sereja's <b>i<\/b>-th circle. After each query you should output two integers: <b>x<\/b> and <b>y<\/b> - position of the center of the circle, if you don't want to place current circle you can output <b>-1 -1<\/b>, you are allowed to skip circle in this way at most <b>skip<\/b> times.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input + Output:<\/b>\n5 10 2\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\n>1\n<9 1\n>1\n<1 9\n>2\n<-1 -1\n>2\n<-1 -1\n>2\n<2 2\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Test generation<\/h3>\n<p>\n<h3>Test Plan #1<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>N = 200, S = 5000, skip = 50<\/b><\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>R[i] \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>R[i]<\/b> are generated uniformly randomly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<h3>Test Plan #2<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>N = 200, S = 10000, skip = 50<\/b><\/li>\n<li>100 \u2264 <b>R[i] \u2264 500<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>R[i]<\/b> are generated uniformly randomly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<h3>Test Plan #3<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>N = 200, S = 5000, skip = 25<\/b><\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>R[i] \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<li>Radius of circles of Sereja is generated according to following probability distribution, denoted as <i>nice<\/i> distribution.
