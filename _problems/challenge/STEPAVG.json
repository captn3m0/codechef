{"category_name":"challenge","status":"success","problem_code":"STEPAVG","problem_name":"Stepping Average","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p>Consider the following weird way of finding the average of <b>N<\/b> numbers. Take any two of the numbers and replace them with their average; repeat this operation exactly <b>N<\/b>-1 times. The only remaining number is called the <i>stepping average<\/i> of the initial set. Note that a set may obviously have different stepping averages depending on our choice for every operation.\n<br \/><br \/>\nYour task is, given <b>N<\/b> integers, find a way of performing the operations such that the resulting stepping average is as close to the given integer <b>K<\/b> as possible. Note that this is a challenge problem: you don't have to find the best possible solution, but the better is your solution the more points you get.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case consists of two lines -- the first of them contains two positive integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>K<\/b> (<b>N<\/b> \u2264 1000, <b>K<\/b> \u2264 10<sup>9<\/sup>), the second contains <b>N<\/b> space-separated positive integers <b>A<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>..<b>A<sub>N<\/sub><\/b> (<b>A<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> \u2264 10<sup>9<\/sup>).\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The output for each test case should contain exactly <b>N<\/b>-1 pairs of integers. <b>i<\/b>-th pair (1-based) <b>x y<\/b> means that numbers <b>A<sub>x<\/sub><\/b> and <b>A<sub>y<\/sub><\/b> are chosen at the corresponding operation, their average is written to <b>A<sub>N+i<\/sub><\/b>, and <b>A<sub>x<\/sub><\/b> and <b>A<sub>y<\/sub><\/b> can't be used any more. See example explanation for more clarity.\n\n<h3>Scoring<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>Your score for each test case is just the absolute difference between <b>K<\/b> and your remaining number. Your final score is the average of all test case scores. Your goal is to minimize the final score.\n\n<\/p><p>Note that in order for your submission not to be judged as 'Wrong Answer' the following conditions should be satisfied:\n<ul><li>your output should contain exactly <b>N<\/b>-1 pairs of positive integers separated by at least one space for each test case and nothing else;\n<\/li><li>your output should contain integers strictly less that <b>N<\/b>+<b>i<\/b> in the <b>i<\/b>-th pair (1-based) for each test case;\n<\/li><li>all integers in your output for each test case should be different.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n5 5\n9 1 6 3 4\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n5 2\n4 6\n3 1\n7 8\n\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\n<\/pre>\nWe have 5 integers here: 9 1 6 3 4. The first operation is 5 2, so the 6th number becomes (4+1)\/2 = 2.5, and the 2nd and the 5th numbers are removed, so we have 9 x 6 3 x 2.5 now (here x means a removed number). Then, 4 6 means that the 7th number becomes (3+2.5)\/2 = 2.75, and the 4th and the 6th numbers are removed, resulting in 9 x 6 x x x 2.75. Then, after 3 1 we get x x x x x x 2.75 7.5, and after 7 8 we get x x x x x x x x 5.125. The only number left after the operations is 5.125, so your score for the test case is 0.125.\n\n<h3>Test Case Generation<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>Every official input file contains exactly 10 test cases.
