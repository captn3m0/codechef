One week before the contest, Chef came up with an interesting idea, and wrote the following problem :\u00a0<\/p>\n<p> Given <b>N<\/b> integers <b>A<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, <b>A<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, ..., <b>A<sub>n<\/sub><\/b>, print YES (or NO) if there exists (or not) <b>3<\/b> numbers that form an arithmetic sequence. All integers are between <b>0<\/b> and <b>99999<\/b> (inclusive).<\/p>\n<p> As Chef expected, during the contest, most teams cannot figure out an efficient algorithm to solve it. But in the last minute of the contest, judges get one 10-lines submission, which is judged as correct. The short solution works as follows, if <b>N<\/b> > <b>2000<\/b>, output YES, otherwise brute-force it. <\/p>\n<p> Chef felt extremely disappointed, and he\/she believed that the solution is definitely wrong. Chef is now interested in how to challenge the submission. <\/p>\n<p> Chef needs your help. Chef would like you to find a set of integers, such that no <b>3<\/b> integers form an arithmetic sequence. To make the task more challenging, you are given a list of <b>M<\/b> integers <b>B<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, <b>B<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, ..., <b>B<sub>M<\/sub><\/b>. You can only use integers from this list. The set does not require maximality, but larger sets will score more points.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p> The first line of the input contains an integer <b>M<\/b>   denoting the length of the list. The second line contains <b>M<\/b> space-separated integers <b>B<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, <b>B<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, ..., <b>B<sub>M<\/sub><\/b> denoting the list.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>First output the integer <b>N<\/b> on the first line. Then output <b>N<\/b> integers <b>A<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, <b>A<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, ..., <b>A<sub>N<\/sub><\/b> on the second line.<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>M<\/b> \u2264 <b>100000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>0<\/b> \u2264 <b>B<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> &lt; <b>100000<\/b> for each <b>1<\/b> \u2264 <b>i<\/b> \u2264 <b>M<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Scoring<\/h3>\n<p>Your score for each test file is <b>100*N\/M<\/b>. Your overall score is the average of your scores on the individual test files. The goal is to maximize your score.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n4\n1 4 6 9\n\n<\/pre><h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>This sample output would score <b>100*4\/10=40<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3>Test Generation<\/h3>\n<p> We have <b>50<\/b> official test cases, each of them is created as follows:<br \/>\nAn integer <b>L<\/b> is chosen from <b>[10000, 100000]<\/b> uniformly at random. An real value <b>p<\/b> is chosen from <b>[0.1, 0.9]<\/b> uniformly at random. Then each number <b>x<\/b> from <b>[0, L - 1]<\/b>, <b>x<\/b> is added into the list with probability <b>p<\/b>, independently. Regenerate the list if it's empty. <\/p>\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, SCALA, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, PERL6, TEXT, CLOJ, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"ACRush","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #D0011B;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>7&#9733;<\/span><span>ACRush<\/span>","problem_tester":"tuananh93","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>tuananh93<\/span>","date_added":"25-04-2013","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ACRush'>ACRush<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/challenge'>challenge<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/june13'>june13<\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CHAORNOT","time":{"view_start_date":1371460885,"submit_start_date":1371460885,"visible_start_date":1371460885,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525199657},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
