The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. Your goal is to maximise the score of your submission.\r\n\r\nThere are eight test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly one test file from each group, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 50% (4\/8) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other 4 test files.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY20\/hindi\/DYNHUL.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY20\/bengali\/DYNHUL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY20\/mandarin\/DYNHUL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY20\/russian\/DYNHUL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JULY20\/vietnamese\/DYNHUL.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nThere are $N$ points in a plane (numbered $1$ through $N$).
