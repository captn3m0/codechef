The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 boxes (also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1 to 9 only one time each. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid.\"\n\nThe rules for an N<sup>2<\/sup> X N<sup>2<\/sup> sudoku are as follows :\n<ul type=\"1\">\n<li>The board is consists of N<sup>2<\/sup> rows and N<sup>2<\/sup> columns.<\/li>\n<li>Numbers between 1 and N<sup>2<\/sup>(inclusive) are to be filled in each row such that :<\/li>\n<ul type=\"1\"><li>All numbers in each row are distinct.<\/li>\n<li>All numbers in each column are distinct.<\/li>\n<li>All numbers in the sub-matrix having rows from (i*N + 1) to(i + 1)*N, and columns from (j*N + 1) to (j + 1)*N both inclusive, should be distinct. 0 &lt;= i,j &lt;= N-1. Rows and columns are 1 indexed. Each such sub-matrix is called a \"box\" or \"region\".<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n\nFor this problem, you are required to solve a general N<sup>2<\/sup>X N<sup>2<\/sup> sudoku puzzle. Given a partially filled sudoku board, you have to fill it in as \"perfect\" a manner as possible.\n<h3>\nInput :\n<\/h3><\/p><p>\nThe first line contains N,K.\nThe following K lines contain 3 numbers: x, y and d. 1 &lt;= x,y,d &lt;= N^2.\nThis means that a number d is present on the board at position (x,y)\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 30\n0 &lt;= K &lt;= N<sup>4<\/sup>\nAt most 50% of the board will be covered at the start.\nAll positions (x,y) in the input will be unique.\n<h3>\nOutput :<\/h3><\/p><p>\nThe output consists of N<sup>2<\/sup> rows having N<sup>2<\/sup> numbers each. Each number should be between 1 and N<sup>2<\/sup> (inclusive) and separated by a space. If the initial grid has a number d at position (x,y), then even the output should have the number d at position (x,y).\n<h3>\nScoring :<\/h3><\/p><p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nFor each row and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2<\/sup> that is missing from the row, incurs a penalty of 1.<\/li>\n<li>For each column and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2<\/sup> that is missing from the column, incurs a penalty of 1.<\/li>\n<li>Similary, for each box and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2<\/sup> that is missing from the box, incurs a penalty of 1.<\/li><\/ul>\nA box (as explained above) is a N X N square and the grid can be divided into N<sup>2<\/sup> such non-overlapping boxes.\n<h3>\nExample :<\/h3><\/p><p>\n<h3>\nInput:<\/h3>\n<pre>\n2 4\n1 2 1\n2 4 4\n3 3 1\n4 1 3\n<\/pre><h3>\nOutput:<\/h3>\n<pre>\n2 1 3 4\n1 2 4 4\n3 4 1 2\n3 2 4 1\n<\/pre>\n<h3>\nPenalty:<\/h3> (0 + 1 + 0 + 0) + (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (2 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 11<\/p>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"3","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin","problem_author_html_handle":"admin","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"11-08-2009","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin'>admin<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1251196670,"submit_start_date":1251196670,"visible_start_date":1251196670,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1528985566},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
