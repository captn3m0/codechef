Find the number of sequences with $K$ elements which satisfy the following conditions:
- Each element is an integer between $L$ and $R$ inclusive.
- The bitwise XOR of all elements is between $A$ and $B$ inclusive.
  
Since the number of sequences satisfying the given conditions can be quite large, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $L$, $R$, $A$, $B$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of valid sequences modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $0 \le L \le R \lt 2^{60}$
- $0 \le A \le B \lt 2^{60}$
- $1 \le K \le 50$

### Example Input
```
3
26 54 18 34 1
3 5 4 7 2
2 9 0 100 3
```

### Example Output
```
9
4
512
```

###EXPLANATION:
In the first testcase, we have to choose one integer in $[26, 54] \cap [18, 34] = [26, 34]$. So, there are 9 ways.

In the second testcase, we have to choose two integers in $[3, 5]$ with bitwise xor in $[4, 7]$. There are 4 possible ways:
- $3 \oplus 4= 7$
- $3 \oplus 5 = 6$
- $4 \oplus 3 = 7$
- $5 \oplus 3 = 6$.

In the third testcase all $8^3$ possible sequences are valid, hence the answer is $512$.
