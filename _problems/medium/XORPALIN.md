In this problem, we are working with binary strings with length $K$. A binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'. The bitwise XOR of two such strings $X$ and $Y$ (denoted by $X \oplus Y$) is also a binary string with length $K$.

You have a sequence $A$ of binary strings, indexed from $1$. Initially, it is empty.

You should process $Q$ queries. In each query:
- You are given two integers $L$ and $R$ ($0 \le L \le R \lt 2^K$). For each $i$ ($L \le i \le R$), consider the string which is the binary representation of $i$, possibly padded with leading zeros so its length is exactly $K$; append this string to $A$. In total, you should append $(R - L + 1)$ strings to $A$ in this query.
- Then, compute the number of pairs $(i, j)$ ($1 \le i \lt j \le |A|$) such that $(A_i \oplus A_j)$ is a palindrome. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $Q$ and $K$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of pairs of strings in $A$ such that their XOR is a palindrome, modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 25,000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 60$
- $0 \leq L \leq R \lt 2^K$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $25,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (5 points):**
- $K \leq 5$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$

**Subtask #2 (10 points):** $L = R$

**Subtask #3 (25 points):**
- $K \leq 50$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $50$

**Subtask #4 (25 points):**
- $K \le 20$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

**Subtask #5 (15 points):**
- $K \le 40$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

**Subtask #6 (20 points):** original constraints

### Example Input

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The sequence $A$ after the first query is ["011", "100", "101", "110"]. The valid pairs of indices are $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$ and $(1,4)$.

After the second query, the sequence $A$ is ["011", "100", "101", "110", "010", "011"]. The valid pairs of indices are $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, $(1,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,6)$ and $(4,6)$.
