### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/mandarin/MXMNSSUM.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/bengali/MXMNSSUM.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/russian/MXMNSSUM.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME100/vietnamese/MXMNSSUM.pdf) as well.

You are given a positive integer $k$ and an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. You will partition the array into $k$ non-empty segments such that each number belongs to exactly one segment. 

Let's denote $s_i$ as the sum of all numbers belonging to $i$-th segment after partitioning. Your goal is to maximize the value of $min(s_1, \ldots, s_k)$. Calculate and print this value.
