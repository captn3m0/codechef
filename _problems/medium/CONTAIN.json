He has $N$ points $(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \\ldots, (X_N, Y_N)$ in a 2D plane, and a candle which he wants to place at some point in this plane.\r\n\r\nThe cake is made up of a non-negative number of layers. Chef considers the deliciousness of the cake to be equal to the number of layers in the cake. A layer is a simple polygon whose vertices are some of Chef's $N$ points. It is not required for each of Chef's points to belong to a layer. Furthermore, the layers must satisfy the following conditions:\r\n- For each layer, the candle must lie strictly inside it.\r\n- Each of Chef's $N$ points that lies strictly inside some layer must belong to some other layer **or be the candle point**.\r\n- No two layers may touch or intersect.\r\n- The layers must be chosen in such a way that the deliciousness of the cake is maximum possible.\r\n\r\nNow, Chef is wondering about how the deliciousness of the cake depends on where he places the candle. You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given a point $p = (x, y)$ where Chef wants to place the candle and you have to find the deliciousness of the cake.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.\r\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$.\r\n- Each of the following $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ describing a query.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the deliciousness of the cake.\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\r\n- $1 \\le N \\le 5,000$\r\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 2,000$\r\n- $|X_i|, |Y_i| \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\r\n- $|x|, |y| \\le 10^9$\r\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$\r\n- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2,000$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (15 points):** $N \\le 12$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (20 points):** for each valid $i$, $X_i = 0$ or $Y_i = 0$\r\n\r\n**Subtask #3 (65 points):** original constraints\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n1\r\n6 2\r\n0 0\r\n6 0\r\n3 4\r\n2 1\r\n4 1\r\n3 3\r\n6 6\r\n3 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n0\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:**\r\n- In the first query, $p = (6, 6)$. The cake cannot have any layers, so its deliciousness is $0$.\r\n- In the second query, $p = (3, 3)$. The cake can have only one layer, e.g. a triangle with vertices $(2, 1), (4, 1), (3, 4)$. Other choices of this layer are also possible, but the cake can never have more than one layer.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JUNE20\/hindi\/CONTAIN.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JUNE20\/bengali\/CONTAIN.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JUNE20\/mandarin\/CONTAIN.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JUNE20\/russian\/CONTAIN.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/JUNE20\/vietnamese\/CONTAIN.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nIt is Chefina's birthday and Chef wants to prepare a cake for her.
