This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le T \\le 10$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 30$\n- $-1000 \\le x_i \\le 1000$\n- $-1000 \\le y_i \\le 1000$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $30$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/russian\/RNDCHULL.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/mandarin\/RNDCHULL.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKEL21\/vietnamese\/RNDCHULL.pdf) as well.\n\nYou are given two increasing arrays of $N$ integers $x_1 \\lt x_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt x_N$ and $y_1 \\lt y_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt y_N$.\n\nFor a permutation $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\ldots,\\sigma_N$ of integers $1,2,\\ldots,N$, let's define $A(\\sigma)$ in the following way:\n\n- Consider the points $(x_1, y_{\\sigma_1}), (x_2, y_{\\sigma_2}), \\ldots, (x_N, y_{\\sigma_N})$.
