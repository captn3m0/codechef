This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq B_i \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq Z_i \\leq 10^5$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n- The sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask #1 (5 points):**\n- $1\\leq M \\leq 10$\n- $1\\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- $0\\leq B_i \\leq 10^3$\n- $0\\leq Z_i \\leq 10^3$\n- The sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$\n\n**Subtask #2 (40 points):**\n- $1\\leq M \\leq 10^3$\n- $1\\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- $0\\leq B_i \\leq 10^3$\n- $0\\leq Z_i \\leq 10^3$\n- The sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$\n\n**Subtask #3 (55 points):**\n- Original constraints\n\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/FUNARR.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/FUNARR.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/FUNARR.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/FUNARR.pdf) as well.\n\nThe *functional array* of an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N]$ is the array $fA$ of size $N-1$, where $fA_i = A_{i+1} - A_i$ for $1\\leq i \\lt N$.
