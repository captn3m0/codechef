Consider any way to pair the integers $1$ through $2N$ into $N$ pairs $(A_1,B_1), (A_2,B_2), \ldots, (A_N,B_N)$ in such a way that each of these integers is present in exactly one pair, $A_i \lt B_i$ for each valid $i$ and $A_1 \lt A_2 \lt \ldots \lt A_N$. Let's call such a sequence of pairs a *pairing*.

For a pairing $(A_1,B_1), (A_2,B_2), \ldots, (A_N,B_N)$, we can create an undirected graph with $2N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $2N$) and the following edges:
- first type: for each valid $i$, an edge between nodes $i$ and $i+1$
- second type: for each valid $i$, an edge between nodes $A_i$ and $B_i$

This pairing is valid if for each edge $(i,i+1)$ of the first type, there is an edge of the second type $(A_j, B_j)$ which "surrounds" it, i.e. satisfies $A_j \le i$ and $B_j \gt i$. The *cost* of a valid pairing is defined as the number of pairs of edges of the second type such that one of these edges is "nested" in the other, i.e. pairs $(A_i, B_i)$ and $(A_j, B_j)$ such that $A_i \lt A_j \lt B_j \lt B_i$.

Find the sum of costs of all valid pairings. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo a given prime $P$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $P$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the sum of costs of all valid pairings modulo $P$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^2$
- $2 \le N \le 10^3$
- $1 \le P \le 10^9$
- $P$ is prime
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** $N \le 10$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** For $N = 2$, there are two valid pairings $[(1,3), (2,4)]$ and $[(1,4), (2,3)]$, with costs $0$ and $1$ respectively.

**Example case 2:** For $N = 3$, all valid pairings along with their costs are listed below. 
- $[(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)]$ with cost $0$
- $[(1,4), (2,6), (3,5)]$ with cost $1$
- $[(1,5), (2,4), (3,6)]$ with cost $1$
- $[(1,5), (2,6), (3,4)]$ with cost $2$
- $[(1,6), (2,5), (3,4)]$ with cost $3$
- $[(1,6), (2,4), (3,5)]$ with cost $2$
- $[(1,3), (2,6), (4,5)]$ with cost $1$
- $[(1,3), (2,5), (4,6)]$ with cost $0$
- $[(1,6), (2,3), (4,5)]$ with cost $2$
- $[(1,5), (2,3), (4,6)]$ with cost $1$

The sum of all costs is $13$ and its remainder modulo $5$ is $3$.
