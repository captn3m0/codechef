Chef is experimenting in his kitchen. He has $N$ spices (numbered $0$ through $N-1$) with types $S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_{N-1}$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. Each query is described by two integers $L$ and $R$. In each query, Chef wants to use the spices $S_L, S_{L+1}, \ldots, S_R$ in some order to make a dish. However, he has no clue about the order in which he should use them to make a perfect dish, so he wants to try all possible orders (sequences created by permuting these $R-L+1$ spices) to find out. Tell Chef the number of distinct orders (sequences) of spices he needs to try. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.

Two sequences of spices are considered different if there is a valid index $i$ such that the type of the $i$-th spice in one sequence is different from the type of the $i$-th spice used in the other sequence.

Note that the input is encoded so that you have to answer the queries online.
  
### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers $S_0, S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{N-1}$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains four space-separated integers $L_1$, $L_2$, $R_1$ and $R_2$ describing a query. The parameters $L$ and $R$ can be calculated in the following way:
    - Let's denote the answer to the previous query by $a$; for the first query, $a = 0$.
    - Calculate $L = (L_1 \cdot a + L_2) \% N$ and $R = (R_1 \cdot a + R_2) \% N$.
    - Then, if $L \gt R$, swap $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of distinct orders of spices modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N, Q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le S_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $0 \le L_1, L_2, R_1, R_2 \le N-1$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (40 points):**
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $L_1 = R_1 = 0$

**Subtask #3 (30 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$

**Subtask #4 (20 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
5 3
1 2 3 7 10
1 1 1 1
2 1 3 4
0 0 0 4
```

### Example Output
```

2
120
```
