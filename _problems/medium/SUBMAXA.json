He went to a store which sells candies from $N$ jars, arranged in a circle and numbered $1$ through $N$ in such a way that for each valid $i$, jars $i$ and $i+1$ are adjacent, and jars $1$ and $N$ are also adjacent. For each valid $i$, the candies in the $i$-th jar have a sweetness $A_i$.\r\n\r\nObviously, Chef wants to buy the sweetest candies. However, he gets attracted by a limited-time offer in the store and wants to use it. The offer is as follows: Chef has to choose an integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le N$), then choose $k$ jars which are contiguous in the circle, and finally, he can buy the candies from these jars at a discounted price. For a fixed $k$, Chef chooses the $k$ contiguous jars uniformly randomly (among all possible sets of $k$ contiguous jars), but once he chooses them, he buys only candies with the largest sweetness among the chosen jars.\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, Chef is confused about which value of $k$ to choose. For each valid $k$, let's denote the expected value of the sweetness of the candies he will buy if he chooses this value of $k$ by $S_k$. Then, let's denote $F_k = S_k \\cdot N$; it can be proved that for each valid $k$, $F_k$ is an integer. Can you help Chef find the values of $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_N$?\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
