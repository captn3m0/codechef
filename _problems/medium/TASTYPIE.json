Now he wants to taste all the pies, but by following a rather peculiar order of tasting.\n\nAt each step, he chooses (uniformly randomly and independently) either the current leftmost pie or the rightmost pie, and eats that pie.\n\nFor example, if $N = 7$, then one valid order of tasting the pies is $(1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 6, 5)$.
