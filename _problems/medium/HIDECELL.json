{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"HIDECELL","problem_name":"Hidden Cell","body":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/mandarin\/HIDECELL.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/bengali\/HIDECELL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/russian\/HIDECELL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/vietnamese\/HIDECELL.pdf) as well.\n\nThere is an $N \\times N$ matrix. Let $(i, j)$ denote the cell in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column, where the rows are numbered $0, 1, \\ldots, N - 1$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $0, 1, \\ldots N-1$ from left to right. There is a hidden cell $(a, b)$. It  is known that this cell doesn't lie on the boundary of the matrix. That is, $\\min(a, b) \\geq 1$ and $\\max(a, b) < N - 1$.\n\nYour task is to recover the hidden cell. You can ask queries, in which you give the judge a matrix $M$ of size $N \\times N$, consisting of zeroes and ones. Let's call a cell $(i, j)$ *valid* if $(i, j) = (a, b)$ or $M_{i,j} = 1$. The judge replies whether there exists a path from $(0, 0)$ to $(N - 1, N - 1)$ consisting of only valid cells, moving only down and right.\n\nFormally, it tells whether there exits a sequence of $2N - 1$ cells $(0 = u_0, 0 = v_0), (u_1, v_1), \\ldots, (N - 1 = u_{2N-2}, N - 1 = v_{2N-2})$, such that $(u_i, v_i)$ is a valid cell for all $i$ and either $(u_{i + 1} = u_i, v_{i + 1} = v_i + 1)$ or $(u_{i + 1} = u_i + 1, v_{i + 1} = v_i)$.\n\nThe score of your submission is a function of the number of queries asked. Please refer to the scoring section for more details.\n\nNote that the grader is **not** adaptive, which means that the hidden cell is fixed in the beginning and won't change according to the queries you ask.\n\n###Input\n\n- First, you should read a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.\n- For each test case, first read the value of $N$.\n- To make a query, you should first print `?` on a new line. Then you should print $N$ lines each containing a string of $N$ characters denoting the matrix $M$.\n- If the query format is incorrect (i.e. if the matrix doesn't have dimensions $N \\times N$ or if some character in the matrix is not $0$ or $1$), or if you have asked more than $120$ queries, the judge prints `-1`, and exits with a wrong answer verdict. In this case, you must also terminate your program.\n- Once you know the hidden cell, print a character `!` on a new line. In the next line, print two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$, the row and column numbers of the hidden cell respectively.\n- If your answer is incorrect, the judge prints `-1` and exits  with a Wrong Answer verdict. In this case, you must terminate your program as well. Otherwise, **the judge prints `1`**, and you should move to the next test case (if any).\n\nNote that whenever the judge prints `\u22121`, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\n\n### Test Data and Scoring\nEach test file has exactly $50$ test cases all with $N = 50$.\n\nLet $Q$ be the maximum number of queries asked by you over all the test cases of all the test files.\n\n- If $Q > 120$, you get $0$ points.\n- If $61 \\le Q \\le 120$, you get $9$ points.\n- If $51 \\le Q \\le 60$, you get $24$ points.\n- If $Q \\le 50$, you get $54 + \\left \\lfloor \\dfrac{46 \\times (50 - \\max(Q, 14))}{36} \\right \\rfloor$ points, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer $\\le x$.  In particular, you get $54$ points if $Q = 50$ and $100$ points if $Q \\le 14$. \n\n\n### Interaction Example\n\n```\nYou                     Grader\n                        3           # 3 test cases\n                        4           # N = 4\n?\n1100\n0100\n0001\n1111\n                        1           # The judge tells that there is\n                                    # a valid path.\n!\n2 1\n\n                        1           # Correct answer! \n\n                        4           # Next test case, N = 4\n\n?\n1000\n0000\n0010\n0001\n                        0           # There doesn't exist a path\n!\n2 2\n                        -1          # Incorrect output! Judge exits\nYou should also\nterminate here\nwithout reading\nthe next test case\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nPlease note that a small value of $T, N$ is used for explanation purposes. In all the actual tests, $T = 50, N = 50$.\n\nIn the first example, $(2, 1)$ is the hidden cell. You ask the query:\n\n```\n1100\n0100\n0001\n1111\n\n```\nThe path $(0, 0) \\to (0, 1) \\to (1, 1) \\to (2, 1) \\to (3, 1) \\to (3, 2) \\to (3, 3)$ consists of only valid cells and the judge replies with $1$.\n\nIn the second test case, the hidden cell is $(1, 1)$. When you ask the query\n```\n1000\n0000\n0010\n0001\n```\nOnly all the diagonal cells are valid. There is no path from $(0, 0)$ to $(3, 3)$ passing only through valid cells, so the judge replies with $0$.\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/mandarin\/HIDECELL.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/bengali\/HIDECELL.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/russian\/HIDECELL.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME97\/vietnamese\/HIDECELL.pdf) as well.\n\nThere is an $N \\times N$ matrix.
