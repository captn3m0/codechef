<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then or equal to 10).   Followed by t lines which contain two numbers m and n (1 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000000, n-m&lt;=100000) separated by a space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m &lt;= p &lt;= n, one number per line.  Separate the answers for each test case by an empty line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
