Shridhar wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers.

### Input

The first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then or equal to 10). Followed by t lines which contain two numbers m and n (1 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000000, n-m&lt;=100000) separated by a space.

### Output

For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m &lt;= p &lt;= n, one number per line. Separate the answers for each test case by an empty line.

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
2
1 10
3 5

<b>Output:</b>
2
3
5
7

3
5
</pre>
