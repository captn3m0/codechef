He was trying to solve a problem involving finding the <b>shortest path<\/b> in a weighted, undirected graph. He thought it was quite standard, so he coded the solution and submitted it. Unfortunately it was judged \u201cWrong Answer\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wanting to debug, Chef downloaded Peter Xor's accepted solution. He also made a test case, illustrated by the following image:<\/p>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/codechef_shared\/download\/upload\/JULY16\/XORPath.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>Now, what is the cost of the shortest path from 1 to 5? Chef thought that the answer should be <b>36 + 16 + 18 = 70<\/b>, because the other candidate path has a higher total cost of <b>36 + 50 + 11 + 18 = 115<\/b>. But he was surprised when Peter Xor's accepted solution outputted <b>15<\/b>! Chef was confused because he can't see any path with a total cost of <b>15<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<p>After rereading the problem, Chef found his mistake. The problem's title was actually <b>Xortest path<\/b>, not <b>Shortest path<\/b>, so the problem was actually asking for the path between two given nodes with <b>the least possible XOR<\/b>! So in the example above, the answer is indeed <b>15<\/b>, because the path <b>1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5<\/b> has an XOR cost of <b>36 \u2295 50 \u2295 11 \u2295 18 = 15<\/b>, and no other path has a lower XOR cost than this. In other words, this is the \u201cxortest path\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now that Chef knows his mistake, he still has a problem; he doesn't know how to answer this problem! Your task as his sous-chef is to answer this problem for him. Specifically, you have to answer <b>Q<\/b> queries, where each query is a pair of nodes, and the answer is the weight of the \u201cxortest path\u201d between them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that in this problem, a <b>path<\/b> may pass through an edge or node any number of times. (Some authors would call such a path a <b>walk<\/b>.) For instance, in the example above, the path <b>1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5<\/b> is also a \u201cxortest path\u201d, because its XOR cost is <b>36 \u2295 16 \u2295 11 \u2295 50 \u2295 16 \u2295 18 = 15<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains three integers, <b>N<\/b>, <b>E<\/b> and <b>Q<\/b>. Nodes are labelled <b>1<\/b> to <b>N<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>The following <b>E<\/b> lines describe the edges. The <b>i<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> line contains three integers <b>a<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, <b>b<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>c<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, which means that there is an undirected edge between nodes <b>a<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>b<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> with weight <b>c<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>The following <b>Q<\/b> lines describe the queries. The <b>j<sup>th<\/sup><\/b> line contains two integers <b>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/b> and <b>y<sub>j<\/sub><\/b>, which means that you need to find the \u201cxortest path\u201d between nodes <b>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/b> and <b>y<sub>j<\/sub><\/b>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output <b>Q<\/b> lines, one for each query.
