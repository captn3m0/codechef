Quite beautifully, wih sparkling light, it seemed to be flying.<br \/>\nBut air does not have ice bergs. <br \/>\nA sudden crashing sound and a piece of ice floating by. But the depth is far greater than what it looks on the surface. <br \/>\nOur ship is hit and has taken serious damages. The iceberg has damaged one of the sectors in the lowermost level. ( Where were the Lookers looking from the Look Out?? !! )\n<br \/>\nThe captain has assigned you the job of finding the total time in sinking of the ship. <br \/>\nThe ship is considered sunk only when all the sectors at all levels are drowned completely in water. <br \/>\n\nA ship is represented in sectors as below: <br \/>\n<pre>\n+ + + + +     \n + + + +\n  + + +\n<\/pre><br \/>\nn is the number of sectors in the topmost level, k is the number of levels. <br \/>\n\nThe first(topmost) level contains n sectors, 2nd contains n-1 sectors, and the k-th(lowermost) sector contains n-k+1 sectors.<br \/>\nA sector can only drown when one of the following conditions are met: <br \/>\n* a neighbor of the sector is completely drowned. <br \/>\n* both the sectors under a sector are completely drowned. <br \/>\n<pre>\n   +  a  +\n     b  c  \n<\/pre>\n\n \"a\" will drown when both \"b\" and \"c\" are drowned.<br \/>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line contains the number of test cases (about 10). t test cases follow. <br \/>\nFor each test case, the first line contains three integers n(&lt;=1000), k(\nThe next k lines contain the integers denoting the time taken for the sectors in k-th level to drown completely.<br \/>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>Display t lines each having the single integer, the total time after which, the ship will be completely submerged in water.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n7 2 3\n2 3 1 7 5 9 6\n4 6 5 4 7 2\n\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n33\n<\/pre>\n<br \/><br \/>\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\nThe sinking time of all the sectors for this example are:\n<pre>\n17  15  12 16 21  27  33\n  15  11   5   9  16  18\n<\/pre>\n<br \/>Hence the answer 33.<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"DCE01","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"DCE01"}
