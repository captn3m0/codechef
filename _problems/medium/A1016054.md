Tsetso likes to play with arrays. 

An Array $A[1,2,\ldots,N]$ is said to be a Tsetso array if $A[1] \cdot A[N] = max(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_{N-1},A_N)$.

Bedo, his teammate, likes to solve problems so much, so Tsetso gave him an array $A$ of $N$ $\bf{distinct}$ integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and $Q$ queries of the form $[L, R]$ and asked him to count the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range.

A subarray$[L,R]$ is to be a Tsetso subarray if $A[L] \cdot A[R] = max(A_L,A_{L+1},....,A_{R-1},A_R)$.

Bedo spent a lot of time trying to solve it, but he couldn't, can you?

$\bf{Note}$: A sequence $a$ is a subarray of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
