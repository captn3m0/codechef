A string is *almost palindromic* if we can rearrange its characters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome. A positive integer is almost palindromic if its decimal representation without leading zeros is an almost palindromic string.

You are given two integers $L$ and $R$. Find the number of almost palindromic integers between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$ (without leading zeros).

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of almost palindromic integers modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le L \le R \lt 10^{10^6}$
- the sum of lengths of $R$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Example Input
```
4
1 10
1 100
1 2020
123456789 1000000000
```

### Example Output
```
9
19
300
40137232
```
