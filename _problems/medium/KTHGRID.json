This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le N \\le 5000$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 5000$\n- $1 \\le seed \\le 10^{18}$\n- $1 \\le minR \\le maxR \\le N$\n- $1 \\le minC \\le maxC \\le N$\n\n**Important note about generator input and constraints for subtasks:**  \nNone of the intended solutions for any subtasks uses input format (pseudorandomness) to get better complexity. They can have slightly (less than an order of magnitude) better constant factor due to the input format, and **TL\/limitations are set based on the runtime of our solutions on the generated tests**.  \nML on CodeChef is 1.5 GB. TL in this problem is 8 seconds. For any of the first 4 subtasks and any solution that is *intended* to pass it, the following holds:  \nThere exists an implementation of this solution in C++ that uses less than 1 GB of memory and less than 5 seconds per test on those subtasks.  \nThe last two subtasks are added for fun of top contestants :)\n\n**To get your verdict faster and not kill our servers it is highly recommended not to execute your program on tests from subtasks you are not even dreaming to pass.** If you are just trying to get those juicy 20 extra points from subtask 3, please put `assert(N <= 2500)` after reading input.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1 (5 points)**: $N \\le 500$, $Q \\le 5000$\n- **Subtask 2 (30 points)**: $N \\le 1500$, $Q \\le 5000$\n- **Subtask 3 (20 points)**: $N \\le 2500$, $Q \\le 4000$\n- **Subtask 4 (40 points)**: $N \\le 4000$, $Q \\le 4000$\n- **Subtask 5 (3 points)**: $N \\le 4500$, $Q \\le 4500$\n- **Subtask 6 (2 points)**: Original constraints","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/mandarin\/KTHGRID.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/russian\/KTHGRID.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME101\/vietnamese\/KTHGRID.pdf) as well.\n\nGiven is a $N \\times N$ grid $A_{rc}$ which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to $N^2$.
