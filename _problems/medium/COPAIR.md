### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME86/hindi/COPAIR.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME86/bengali/COPAIR.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME86/mandarin/COPAIR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME86/russian/COPAIR.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME86/vietnamese/COPAIR.pdf) as well.

You are given two sequences $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_N$. For each valid $i$, $C_i$ is the colour of $A_i$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query:
- You are given two colours $x$ and $y$.
- Consider the subsequence of $A$ which contains only elements $A_i$ such that $C_i = x$ or $C_i = y$ (in the original order). Let's denote it by $B$.
- For each contiguous subsequence of $B$ (including empty subsequence), consider the sum of all its elements. Find the maximum of these sums. 


### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_N$.
- $Q$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of $B$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^2$
- $1 \le N, Q \le 3*10^5$
- $|A_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le C_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le x \ne y \le N$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3*10^5$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3*10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** Every color except the color $1$ occurs in at most $1$ query.  

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** Original constraints
