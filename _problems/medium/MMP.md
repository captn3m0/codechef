### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/MMP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/MMP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/MMP.pdf) as well.

There are $N$ stones numbered $1$ through $N$. Each stone has a value written on it; for each valid $i$, the value on stone $i$ is $V_i$.

You are initially on the first stone and your goal is to jump to stone $N$ by perfoming a valid sequence of jumps. Formally, let's denote a sequence of visited stones during these jumps by $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_M$, where $M-1$ is the number of jumps. Then, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- $1 = S_1 \lt S_2 \lt \ldots \lt S_M = N$
- for each $i$ ($1 \le i \lt M$), $\min(V_{S_1}, V_{S_2}, \ldots, V_{S_i}) + \max(V_{S_{i+1}}, \ldots, V_{S_M}) = S_{i+1} - S_i$, which is the length of the $i$-th jump

Find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach stone $N$, or report that it is impossible to reach stone $N$ using valid jumps.
