All submissions for this problem are available.Alice has learnt factorization recently. Bob doesn't think she has learnt it properly and hence he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a product of **N** numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your task is simple. Given **N** numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of these **N** numbers.

### Input:

First line of input contains a single integer **T**, the number of test cases.

Each test starts with a line containing a single integer **N**.
 The next line consists of **N** space separated integers (**Ai**).

### Output:

For each test case, output on a separate line the total number of factors of the product of given numbers.

### Constraints:

<pre>
1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 100
1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 10
2 ≤ <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ 1000000

</pre>
### Example:

**Input:**

<pre>
3
3
3 5 7
3
2 4 6
2
5 5

</pre>
**Output:**

<pre>
8
10
3

</pre>
### Scoring:

You will be awarded **40** points for correctly solving for **Ai** ≤ 100.

You will be awarded another **30** points for correctly solving for **Ai** ≤ 10000.

The remaining **30** points will be awarded for correctly solving for **Ai** ≤ 1000000.
