This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 20$\n- $3 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $-5 \\cdot 10^8 \\leq P_i.x, P_i.y \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^8$\n- The convex hull of the input set $P$ has positive area\n- Sum of $N$ over all tests cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (20 points):**\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$\n\n**Subtask 2 (80 points):**\n- Original constraints\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/bengali\/CONHULK.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/russian\/CONHULK.pdf), [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/mandarin\/CONHULK.pdf) and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/NOV21\/vietnamese\/CONHULK.pdf) as well.\n\nHulk has a set of distinct points $P$ in the 2D plane. His signature move is $Hulk$ $Smash$. He performed $Hulk$ $Smash$ on the set $P$ which caused the points to change, and so he obtained a new set of points $P'$.\n\nMore formally, $Hulk$ $Smash$ makes the new set $P'$ in the following way:\n- Initially, let $P'$ be empty.\n- For every $P_i$ and $P_j$ such that $1 \\le i \\lt j \\le N$ , add the mid point of $P_i$ and $P_j$ to the set $P'$ (only if it didn't exist in it already).\n\nSo, $P'$ is the set of midpoints of line segments connecting pairs of distinct points of $P$.\nNote that points from $P$ do not necessarily have to be in $P'$. See the samples below for a graphical example.\n\nFind the number of points of $P'$ which lie on the [convex hull](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convex_hull) of $P'$. A point is said to lie on the convex hull if the shape of the convex hull is changed when this point is removed.","inputFormat":"- The first line contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
