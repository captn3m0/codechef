You're given an array $A$ with $N$ integers. 
Define $F(A, i, j) = (A[j]-A[i]) \cdot (j-i)$.

Consider the set $P$ of all pairs $(i, j)$ such that $1 \leq i \lt j  \leq N$. For a subset $S$ of $P$, we define $\texttt{beauty}(S, A)$ as the sum of $F(A, i, j)$ over all pairs $(i, j)$ contained in $S$. We also define $V(A)$ as the maximum value of $\texttt{beauty}(S, A)$ over all subsets $S$ of $P$.

You also have a machine that takes a copy of the initial array $A$ as an input and performs $K$ pre-defined operations on it in a fixed order. In each operation, it takes two indices, $X_i$ and $Y_i$, and swaps the elements present at those positions in the array at that moment in time. After that, it outputs the final array. You know what these operations are and the order in which they are performed.

However, the machine is a bit lazy. It may skip some operations. But the order of operations does not change. In other words, it chooses a subsequence (possibly empty) of the operations and performs them in that order.

Find the sum of $V(P)$ over all possible outputs $P$ of the machine (modulo $10^9+7$).

In other words, consider the multiset $R$ of the arrays we get as an output after the machine takes input as $A$ and performs one of the subsequences (possibly empty) of the pre-defined operations. Note that there can be multiple occurrences of the same array in this multiset. Find the value $\sum\limits_{P \in R} V(P)$.

Output the remainder of this value when divided by $10^9+7$.
