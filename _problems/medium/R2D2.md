<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>### Read problem statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/hindi/R2D2.pdf), [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/bengali/R2D2.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/mandarin/R2D2.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/russian/R2D2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/vietnamese/R2D2.pdf) as well.

The droid R2-D2 is travelling in space with a special mission. In space, there are $N$ planets (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ bidirectional space highways. Each space highway connects two planets and in order to use it, R2-D2 needs to have a sufficiently high *status level*.

The droid’s mission consists of $Q$ stages. In each stage, there are two planets $x$ and $y$ such that the droid should start the stage at planet $x$ with some initial status level $L$ ($L \ge 0$) and travel to planet $y$. For each valid $i$, when R2-D2 is at planet $i$ (including the initial planet $x$), he may increase his status level by $A_i$; it is not allowed to increase the status level multiple times on the same planet in the same stage. Find the minimum value of $L$ such that it is possible for R2-D2 to reach planet $y$ or determine that it is impossible to reach planet $y$ for any $L$.

Note that the level R2-D2 has at the end of each stage is not carried over to the next stages (he may start the next stage with a lower initial status level).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- Each of the following $M$ lines contains three space separated integers $U$, $V$ and $W$ denoting that there is a space highway between planets $U$ and $V$ and R2-D2 may use this highway only if his status level is at least $W$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$.
- The following $Q$ lines describe stages. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$.

### Output
For each stage, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum status level required to complete the stage, or $-1$ if it is impossible to complete this stage.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N, M, Q \le 10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $0 \le W \le 10^9$
- $1 \le U, V, x, y \le N$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (12 points):**
- $N, Q \le 1,000$
- $M \le 1,200$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$

**Subtask #2 (28 points):** $A_i = 0$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Explanation
