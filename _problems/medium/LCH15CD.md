 Elections in Bytetown are coming soon!

 Candidate Boris is going to have a small walk. Bytetown can be represented as **N**-dimensional cube with edge size **D**. Initially Boris stands in cell with coordinates **(0, 0, ... 0)** and his destination is cell **(D-1, D-1,... D-1)**. His route consists of chain of the cells, where each pair of consecutive cells differs in exactly one coordinate by 1 and sum of coordinates strictly increases during his walk. Note that Boris walks through the **cells** not points.

But not all the people in Bytetown are going to vote for Boris. Some of them are sure that Boris is a liar and bribetaker and they will tell it to Boris if they meet him. Boris doesn't like such people and avoids them. He knows that at cell with coordinares **(i0, i1,..., iN-1)** he will meet **(i0^ i1^...^iN-1)x(i0+ i1+...+ iN-1)** such people (in other words XOR-sum of coordinates times arithmetic sum of coordinates). Try to help him to find minimal number of unfriendly people he will have to meet.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next **T** lines contain two integer **N** and **D**.

### Output

Output **T** lines. Every line should contain one integer - the minimal number of unfriendly people among all the possible routes Boris will have to meet for the corresponding test case.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **20**
- **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **10**
- Total number of cells in one cube doesn't exceed **216**

###  Subtasks 

**Subtask #1**\[26 points\]: **N = 1**
**Subtask #2**\[29 points\]: **N = 2**
**Subtask #3**\[45 points\]: **N &gt; 2**
