Chef gives you an array $A$ of length $N$, consisting of integers. He asks you to choose a subarray **with at least 2 elements** of the given array. Following, out of your chosen subarray, Chef will pick out any two elements. 

Your net score would be the sum of the remaining elements of the subarray. Obviously, Chef adopts a strategy to **minimize** your score. Find the **maximum** score you can have.
