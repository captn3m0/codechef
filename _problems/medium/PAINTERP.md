Chef is a painter. He likes to draw geometric figures and among them, he especially loves isosceles right triangles. The longest side of a right triangle is called its hypotenuse. Chef drew $N$ isosceles right triangles (numbered $1$ through $N$) on an infinite sheet of paper, which can be represented by a Cartesian half-plane (containing all points $(x, y)$ such that $y \ge 0$), in such a way that the hypotenuse of each triangle lies on the $x$-axis (the line $y=0$). For example, the resulting figure could look like this:

The sides of the triangles and the $x$-axis split the paper into one or more contiguous regions, which Chef calls *districts*. Chef is fascinated by his drawing, so he would like to know how many districts are on his paper. For each valid $i$, the hypotenuse of the $i$-th triangle is the line segment between points $(l_i, 0)$ and $(r_i, 0)$; note that the triangles are uniquely defined by this information.

Help Chef calculate the number of districts in the painting.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $l_i$ and $r_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of districts.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $-10^9 \le l_i \lt r_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the pairs $(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \ldots, (l_N, r_N)$ are distinct

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** $N \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
4
40 110
100 140
-100 100
-100 60
```

### Example Output
```
8
```
	
### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The paper with all triangles and eight numbered districts is shown in the figure below.
