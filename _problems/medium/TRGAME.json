{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"TRGAME","problem_name":"Game on Tree","body":"You are given a tree with $n$ vertices numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$. There are two players Alice and Bob who play a game on this tree, taking turns alternatively.  Alice starts.\r\n\r\nIn their turn a participant has to remove a leaf (and the edge adjacent to it) from the tree. A leaf is a node with degree $1$. Please note, that the tree changes with the game progressing, and a node which is not a leaf in the beginning can become a leaf later and become eligible to be removed.\r\n\r\nAlice likes the vertex $x$ and wants it be the last node remaining. Bob hates node $x$ and doesn't want it to be the last node remaining.\r\n\r\nFor all the choices of vertex $x$, find who wins assuming both play optimally.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThere are multiple independent testcases.\r\n- The first line contains $T$, the number of testcases.\r\n- The first line of each testcase contains a single interger $n$, the number of vertices.\r\n- Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers denoting the endpoints of an edge. Each edge is present only once.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each testcase, print a string of length $n$ on a new line. The $i^{\\text{th}}$ character in this string should be $1$ if Alice wins the game for $x=i$, and $0$ if Bob wins.\r\n\r\n### Constraints \r\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\r\n- $2 \\le n \\le 10^5 $\r\n- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\r\n\r\n### Example Input\r\n```\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\n5\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n3 4\r\n3 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n```\r\n11\r\n00000\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n### Explanation\r\nIn the first testcase. If $x = 1$, Alice removes node $2$ and wins. If $x = 2$, Alice removes node $1$ and wins.\r\n\r\nIn the second testcase, consider $x=1$. If Alice removes node $2$, Bob can remove node $1$ in his turn and win. If Alice removes node $4$, Bob then removes node $2$. Then in her turn, Alice can only remove node $5$ leaving two nodes $1$ and $3$. Bob can now remove node $1$ and win. The game proceeds similarly if Alice removes node $5$ first. So, Bob wins the game.\r\nOne can see that for other choices of $x$ as well, Bob wins.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You are given a tree with $n$ vertices numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$.
