### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/mandarin/SECPLAYER.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/bengali/SECPLAYER.pdf), and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/russian/SECPLAYER.pdf) as well.

There are $N$ players participating in a knockout tournament. The $i$-th player has the rating $A_i$. No two players have the same rating.

$N-1$ matches are played in the tournament. In each match, $2$ random players are chosen out of the remaining players, and the player with the higher rating wins. The losing player gets eliminated from the tournament.

Can you find out the expected rating of the player ending up at the second position (that is, the expected rating of the player losing in the $(N-1)$-th match)? 

The expected rating of the second player can be represented as a fraction of the form $\frac{P}{Q}$. You are required to print $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{1 \, 000 \, 000 \, 007}$.
