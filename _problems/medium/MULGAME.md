### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/hindi/MULGAME.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/bengali/MULGAME.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/mandarin/MULGAME.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/russian/MULGAME.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/vietnamese/MULGAME.pdf) as well.

You are given a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. It is also guaranteed that for each valid $i$, $A_i+A_1 \ge A_{i+1}$.

Alice and Bob want to play $Q$ independent games using this sequence. Before they play these games, Alice should choose a positive integer $G$ between $1$ and $M$ (inclusive). The rules of each game are as follows:
- There is a set $S$ of positive integers representing allowed moves in this game. For each valid $i$, in the $i$-th game, this set is $S = \{A_{L_i},A_{L_i+1},\ldots,A_{R_i}\}$ (in other words, given by a contiguous subsequence of $A$).
- The game is played with a single pile. Let's denote the number of objects in this pile by $P$. At the beginning of the game, $P = G$. In other words, Alice and Bob play all the games with the same initial number of objects that Alice chooses.
- The players alternate turns; Alice plays first.
- In each turn, the current player must choose a positive integer $b$ from the set $S$ such that $b \le P$ and remove $b$ objects from the pile, i.e. change $P$ to $P-b$.
- When the current player cannot choose any such integer $b$, this player loses this game.

Both players play optimally. You need to find the maximum number of games Alice can win if she chooses $G$ optimally.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $Q$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- $Q$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $L_i$ and $R_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of games Alice can win.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le N,Q,M \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^8$ for each valid $i$
- $A_i+A_1 \ge A_{i+1} \gt A_i$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le L_i \le R_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (5 points):** 
- $N,Q,M \leq 400$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** 
- $N,Q,M \leq 5,000$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$
- the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$

**Subtask #3 (65 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3 2 10
2 3 4
1 2
2 3
```

### Example Output
```
2
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The set of allowed moves in the first game is $S = \{2,3\}$ and in the second game, it is $S = \{3,4\}$. If Alice chooses $G=3$, she can win both games.
