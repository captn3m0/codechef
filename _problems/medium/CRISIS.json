{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"CRISIS","problem_name":"CPI Crisis","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span>Naruto has recently joined the Ninja Academy for higher education, while filling the admission form he is required to choose minimum $X$ subjects out of a list of $N$ subjects. He is not very interested in studies but wants to get a good overall CPI. However, every subject has a different weightage\/credit. The credit (denoted as $C$<sub>i<\/sub>) of a particular course is equal to the position in which it appears in the subject list, i.e, the first course has a credit=1, the second course has a credit=2, and so on.\nNaruto knows his capabilities, and so he has come up with the scores ($S$<sub>i<\/sub>)  he can achieve in every course. He wants to maximise his CPI, which can be calculated as the weighted mean of all the subjects taken, denoted as\n__Sum(C<sub>i<\/sub>*S<sub>i<\/sub>)\/Sum(C<sub>i<\/sub>)__ for all i s.t Naruto has taken up course i\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- First line of every test case contains two integers, $N$ and $X$\n- Next line of the test case contains $N$ space separated integers S<sub>i<\/sub>, denoting the score he can get in every subject\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum cpi he can get after choosing the subjects. Your output will be considered correct if it has an absolute error of less than 10<sup>-6<\/sup>.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq X \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq S$<sub>i<\/sub>$   \\leq 10000$\n\n###Sample Input:\n1  \n5 2  \n50 40 30 20 10  \n\n\n###Sample Output:\n43.3333333333\n\n\t\n###Explanation:\nHe can achieve the max credit by picking the first two subjects, which produces a CPI of (50 * 1+40 * 2)\/(1+2) = 43.333333333","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kr_abhinav","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kr_abhinav<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"1-04-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kr_abhinav'>kr_abhinav<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1522873800,"submit_start_date":1522873800,"visible_start_date":1522873800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525454398},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
