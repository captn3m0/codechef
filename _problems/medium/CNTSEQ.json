This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq V_i \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq u, v \\leq N$\n- $u \\ne v$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 10^4$\n- $1 \\le X, R \\le N$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Define $f(x)$ to be the largest divisor of $x$ which is not equal to $x$; in the case of $x = 1$, we define $f(1) = 1$ as an exception.\n\nYou are given a tree containing $N$ nodes numbered from $1$ to $N$, where each node $i$ has a value $V_i$ assigned to it.
