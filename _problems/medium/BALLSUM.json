{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"BALLSUM","problem_name":"Colorful Balloons","body":"It's Alan's birthday. He is looking for balloons to decorate his house. He visits a shop which has many coloured balloons numbered $1$ to $n$ arranged in a row. The colour of each balloon can be represented as an integer between $1$ and $n$. Alan only wants to pick up a **contiguous subsequence** of these balloons. However, the total cost of a set of balloons is calculated in a strange way: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} cnt_i^k$ where $cnt_i$ is the number of balloons of $i^{th}$ colour in the set.\r\n\r\nFind the total cost of all possible sets of balloons that can be bought by Alan. Two sets of balloons are considered different if there is a balloon numbered  $i$  which is present in one set but not in the other.
