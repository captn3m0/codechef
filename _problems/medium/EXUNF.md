You are given a tree with $N$ nodes, numbered from $1$ to $N$. It is  rooted at node $1$.

We call the simple path between node $A$ and node $B$ to be vertical if node $A$ lies on the path from the root to $B$ or node $B$ lies on the path from the root to $A$. In other words, [LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) ($A,B$) must be $A$ or $B$.  And in such cases, we define a node $A$ to lie **above** node $B$ in the tree if distance to $A$ from the root is less than the distance from the root to $B$. Otherwise we define it to lie **below** $B$.

You also have with you $1$ Proton and $E$ Electrons (together called as particles) .  And you need to place these in some nodes of the tree.

Suppose we fix the proton to be at some node $A$. We then call a placement of electrons **valid** if the following conditions are met  :-

- Each node can have at most one particle in it. Also, every particle should be placed in some node.
- Electrons can only be placed in nodes from which the simple path to $A$ is **vertical** (that is, they should either be above $A$, or below $A$).
- At least $X_A$ nodes **above** $A$ should contain an electron and at least $Y_A$ nodes **below** $A$ should contain an electron. 

The Dipole moment for a **valid placement** of electrons is calculated as follows :- 

- Consider the sum of distances from $A$ to nodes which contain an electron and lie **above** $A$. Let this sum be $S_1$.
- Similarly, consider the sum of distances from $A$ to nodes which contain an electron and lie **below** $A$. Let this sum be $S_2$.
- The Dipole Moment is then defined as |$S_1-S_2+Z_A$|, here $Z_A$ is the positive charge if the proton is placed at $A$. Here, |$X$| refers to the absolute value of $X$.


For every $A$ ($1 \leq A \leq N$) print the minimum dipole moment you can achieve among all valid placement in which the node $A$ contains the proton. 

In case there is no valid placement for a particular node $A$, print $-1$ for that.

Note that the distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the simple path between them.
 
###Input:
 
- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which denotes the number of testcases.
- The first line of each testcase will contain two integers, $N$ and $E$, which denote the number of nodes and number of electrons respectively. 
- The next $N-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that thereâ€™s an edge between $u$ and $v$ in the tree.
- The i-th of the next $N$ lines contain 3 space separated integers ,  $X_i,Y_i,Z_i$ 

 
###Output:
- Output $T$ lines, where each line should be containing $N$ space-separated integers, the $A^{th}$ integer should be the minimum dipole moment if the proton is placed at node $A$ , or -1 if there is no valid placement. 
  
###Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 5$
- $2 \leq N \leq 2*10^5$
- $1 \leq u,v \leq N$
- Sum of $N$ over all testcases $\leq 4*10^5$
- $1 \leq E \leq N-1$
- $ 0 \leq |Z_i|  \leq 10^6$
- $ 0 \leq X_i,Y_i  <  N$
- $ 0 \leq X_i+Y_i  \leq  E$
-  $X_A \leq $ number of nodes **above**  $A$, for all $A$. 
- $Y_A \leq $ number of nodes **below** $A$, for all $A$. 


###Subtasks
- 15 points : sum of $N$ over all testcases $ \leq 300$
- 25 points : sum of $N$ over all testcases $ \leq 3000$
- 60 points : Original Constraints.

```

###Sample Output:
```
0 0 7 0 5 1 6 2 1 10 5 13 -1
```

###Explanation:
With the proton fixed at node $1$, we can achieve a dipole moment of $0$ by placing the electrons at nodes $2$ and $12$ for instance.
