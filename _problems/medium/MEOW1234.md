### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/hindi/MEOW1234.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/bengali/MEOW1234.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/mandarin/MEOW1234.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/russian/MEOW1234.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/vietnamese/MEOW1234.pdf) as well.

There is a checkered field with $10^5$ rows (numbered $1$ through $10^5$) and $10^5$ columns (numbered $1$ through $10^5$). $N$ different cells in this field (numbered $1$ through $N$) are marked; for each valid $i$, the coordinates of the $i$-th marked cell are $(x_i, y_i)$.

A set of cells is *suitable* if it meets the following conditions:
- All marked cells belong to this set.
- For any two cells $a$ and $b$ belonging to this set, there is a path between them with length $|x_a - x_b| + |y_a - y_b|$ which only visits cells in this set. Each pair of consecutive cells in a path must have a common side.

You need to find the smallest possible size of a suitable set of cells, as well as the number of sets with this smallest size. Since the number of sets may be very large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $T$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$.

### Output
- If $T = 0$, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest size of a suitable set. 
- If $T = 1$, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the smallest size of a suitable set and the number of sets with this size modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq T \leq 1$
- $1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^5$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $T = 1$
- $x_i \leq 5$ for each valid $i$
- $y_i \leq 4$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $T = 0$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
6 1
3 3
4 3
1 1
5 4
5 2
2 2
```

### Example Output
```
10 2
```

### Explanation
The two suitable sets with the smallest size $10$ are
