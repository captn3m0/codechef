Archi is a small boy from Uzhlyandia. For Chef's birthday, he prepared a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). Each edge in this tree has a certain length.

There are $M$ speedsters on the tree, numbered $1$ through $M$. For each valid $i$, speedster number $i$ starts at time $t_i$ from vertex number $u_i$ and runs straight to vertex number $v_i$ with constant velocity $s_i$. Before time $t_i$, the speedster is not considered to be present in the tree.

Chef is interested in the following question: for each vertex, what is the smallest time when a speedster is present at this vertex?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains three space-separated integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ with length $w$.
- The next line contains a single integer $M$.
- For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of the next $M$ lines contains four space-separated integers $u_i$, $v_i$, $t_i$ and $s_i$ describing the $i$-th speedster.

### Output
For each test case, print $N$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain a single real number â€” the minimum time when the $i$-th vertex is visited by a speedster, or $-1$ if it is never visited. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N, M \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- $1 \le w, t, s \le 10^9$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $M$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^3$
- the sum of $M$ for all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (20 points):** the velocities of all speedsters are identical

**Subtask #3 (20 points):** the tree is a bamboo (a path)

**Subtask #4 (50 points):** original constraints
