###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

You are given a single integer **N**. It's very large, so it's given as a product of several prime powers: **N = p1k1 p2k2 ... pmkm**.

Let's define **φ**(**N**) as [Euler's totient function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function) -- the number of positive integers less than or equal to **N** that are relatively prime to **N**.

Let **N1** = **φ**(**N**). Let **N2** = **φ**(**N1**). Further, let **NX** = **φ**(**NX-1**) for **X** &gt; 2.

Your task is to find the smallest positive integer **X** such that **NX** = 1. Only careful calculation might help... or will it be enough?

### Input

The first line of the input file contains one integer **T** -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing one positive integer **m** followed by **m** lines, each containing two integers **pi** and **ki** (1 &lt; **pi** &lt; 100000, 1 ≤ **ki** ≤ 109) separated by a single space. It's guaranteed that all **pi** are pairwise distinct prime numbers in each test case (note that the upper limit on **m** can be determined from this constraint).

### Output

For each test case output just one line containing the required smallest positive integer **X**.

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
1
2
2 2
3 1

<b>Output:</b>
3

<b>Explanation:</b>
</pre>
In the example test case **N** = 22\*31 = 12. Then **N1** = 4, **N2** = 2 and **NX** = 1 for **X** ≥ 3, so the answer is 3.
