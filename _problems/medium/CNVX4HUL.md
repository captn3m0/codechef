### Read problems statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK104/hindi/CNVX4HUL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK104/mandarin/CNVX4HUL.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK104/russian/CNVX4HUL.pdf), [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK104/vietnamese/CNVX4HUL.pdf) and [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK104/bengali/CNVX4HUL.pdf) as well.

You are given $N$ distinct points on a two-dimensional plane. It is guaranteed that no three of them are collinear. Let's call a subset of these points *compact* if the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of this subset has exactly four vertices.

Find the number of compact non-empty subsets of the given points. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the next $N$ lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ denoting the coordinates of one point.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of compact subsets modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 300$
- $|x|, |y| \le 10^9$
- no two points coincide and no three points are collinear
