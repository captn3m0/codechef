Let $S(N)$ denote the sum of digits of a positive integer $N$. You are given three positive integers $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. Consider all triples of positive integers $(A, B, C)$ such that:
- $S(A+B)=X$
- $S(B+C)=Y$
- $S(C+A)=Z$

Your task is to find the triple which maximises $S(A+B+C)$ and the triple which minimises $S(A+B+C)$. Specifically, you are given an additional integer $P$ with the following meaning:
- If $P = 0$, find the maximum value of $S(A+B+C)$ and one triple $(A, B, C)$ corresponding to this maximum value.
- If $P = 1$, find the minimum value of $S(A+B+C)$ and one triple $(A, B, C)$ corresponding to this minimum value.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $X$, $Y$, $Z$ and $P$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers â€” the minimum or maximum value of $S$ and the corresponding values of $A$, $B$ and $C$.

$A$, $B$ and $C$ should be printed without leading zeros. The number of digits in each of $A$, $B$ and $C$ should not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$. The total number of digits in the integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ in all test cases should not exceed $10^7$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $2 \leq X,Y,Z \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq P \leq 1$
- the sum of $X$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$
- the sum of $Y$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$
- the sum of $Z$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (25 points):**
- $P=0$
- $10 \le X,Y,Z \le 100$
- the sum of $X$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$
- the sum of $Y$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$
- the sum of $Z$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$

**Subtask #2 (25 points):** $P=0$

**Subtask #3 (25 points):**
- $P=1$
- $10 \le X,Y,Z \le 100$
- the sum of $X$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$
- the sum of $Y$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$
- the sum of $Z$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$

**Subtask #4 (25 points):** $P=1$
