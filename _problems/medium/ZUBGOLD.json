With the money he saved he has bought gold. This gold is hidden in a forest which is represented by a 2 dimensional plane in 3 dimensional space. There are two special trees <b>A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b> in the forest. The son needs to find these trees, and a special stone <b>S<\/b>. He must walk from <b>S<\/b> to <b>A<\/b> along the plane representing the forest, and then take a right turn and walk the same distance (ie. walk perpendicular to <b>SA<\/b>), to get to a point <b>C<\/b>. He must then come back to <b>S<\/b>. Next, he should walk from <b>S<\/b> to <b>B<\/b>, take a left turn and then walk that distance again to reach the point <b>D<\/b>. Half way between <b>C<\/b> and <b>D<\/b> is the place where the gold is hidden.<\/p>\n\n<p>The forest is a plane defined by the points <b>S(x<sub>0<\/sub>,y<sub>0<\/sub>,z<sub>0<\/sub>)<\/b>, <b>A(x<sub>1<\/sub>,y<sub>1<\/sub>,z<sub>1<\/sub>)<\/b> and <b>B(x<sub>2<\/sub>,y<sub>2<\/sub>,z<sub>2<\/sub>)<\/b>. <b>S, A<\/b>, and <b>B<\/b> will not be collinear. You need to find the coordinates of the gold. Each input set consists of the coordinates of the points <b>S, A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b> in separate lines. It is guaranteed that the origin <b>O<\/b>(0,0,0) will always be above the forest surface. That is, you standing on the forest surface, if you look up, (0, 0, 0) will be in the sky.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains one integer, <b>T<\/b>, the number of test cases.
