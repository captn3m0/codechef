**FRIENDS** stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer have come together for the much-awaited reunion. The whole cast is going to shoot for the episode on the sets of their show.

Being a huge fan, Chef's family is excited to watch the live shoot. The auditorium has infinite rows with infinite seats in each row. The seats are numbered starting from $1$ like:

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fY3g65f/Screenshot-2021-06-14-at-6-10-15-PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2021-06-14-at-6-10-15-PM" border="2"></a>

Chef wants to reserve exactly $n$ seats for his family members such that the reserved seats form a rectangle and all the family members stay together. The price of each seat is equal to the seat number $s_i$. However, Chef has managed to get a special discount.

From the selected seat numbers, Chef is allowed to choose a reduction price $x$ such that the new price of each of the selected seats will be $|s_i - x |$. Find the minimum price Chef has to pay for reserving $n$ seats. Since this number can be huge, print it modulo ($10^9+7$).

### Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $n$, denoting the number of people in Chef's family.

### Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum price Chef has to pay for reserving $n$ seats module ($10^9+7$).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq n \leq 4*10^5$

### Sample Input:
	3
	4
	103
	2021

### Sample Output:
	5
	136578
	1364637
