All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT16/mandarin/CIRCLEQ.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT16/russian/CIRCLEQ.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SEPT16/vietnamese/CIRCLEQ.pdf) as well.

Chef decided to open a new restaurant in the town. The town already has **N** restaurants, each of which operates in an area of circular shape with its center at **xi, yi** and radius **ri**. For any point, there is at most one restaurant operating there.

Chef wants to build his restaurant in a strategic place. That's why he asks you some questions - find the total area covered by restaurants in the rectangle defined by the points **x1, y1, x2, y2** where **(x1, y1)** is the lower left corner and **(x2, y2)** is the upper right corner. Chef is not that good in answering these questions, so he asked you to help him in this.

### Input

There is a single test case.

The first line of input contains two integers **N, Q**, denoting number of restaurants and number of questions Chef asks.

Each of the next **N** lines contains three space separated integers **x, y, r** denoting **x** and **y** coordinate of center, and the radius of the restaurant, respectively.

Each of the next **Q** lines contains four space separated integers **x1, y1, x2, y2** denoting a question as defined in the statement.

### Output

Output **Q** lines, the **i-th** line contains the total area covered by restaurants in the rectangle defined by the **i-th** query. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed **10-6**

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **50 000**
- **1** ≤ **Q** ≤ **100 000**
- 0 ≤ **xi, yi** ≤ **50 000**
- **1** ≤ **ri** ≤ **50**
- 0 ≤ **xi1** &lt; **xi2** ≤ **50 000**
- 0 ≤ **yi1** &lt; **yi2** ≤ **50 000**
- No two circles touch or intersect each other.

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (10 pts)**

- **N** = **1**

**Subtask #2 (10 pts)**

- **1** ≤ **N, Q** ≤ **1000**
- 0 ≤ **xi, yi** ≤ **1000**
- 0 ≤ **xi1** &lt; **xi2** ≤ **1000**
- 0 ≤ **yi1** &lt; **yi2** ≤ **1000**

**Subtask #3 (10 pts)**

- **1** ≤ **N, Q** ≤ **1000**

**Subtask #4 (20 pts)**

- Original constraints with **ri = 1**

**Subtask #5 (50 pts)**

- Original constraints
