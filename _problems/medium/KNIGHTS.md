###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

Dave recently mastered the problem of placing N queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack eachother. Now he wants to see how many knights he can place on a chessboard so that no two knights attack eachother. Normally this would be a simple task, but some of the squares of the chessboard have been marked as unusable and hence cannot have a knight placed on them.

Recall that a knight can attack another knight if their vertical distance is 2 and their horizontal distance is 1, or if their vertical distance is 1 and their horizontal distance is 2. Only one knight may be placed on each square of the chessboard

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer T (0&lt;T≤50), the number of test cases to follow.

Each test case will begin with a line containing 2 integers M and N (0&lt;M,N≤30), denoting the number of rows and columns, respectively. M lines follow, each containing exactly N characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is '.' if a knight may be placed in the j-th column of the i-th row, and '#' if the square is unusable.

### Output

For each test case, output on a single line the maximum number of knights that may be placed on the chessboard such that no two attack eachother.

### Sample input:

<pre>2
2 4
....

5 5
..#..
#..#.
##...

</pre>
### Sample output:

<pre>4
