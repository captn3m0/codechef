The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string `\"YES\"` if it is possible to partition $A$ into $K$ contiguous subsequences or `\"NO\"` otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to partition $A$, print a second line containing $K$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_K$ denoting the sizes of the subsequences, where $1 \\le B_i$ for each valid $i$ and $B_1 + B_2 + \\ldots + B_K = N$.
