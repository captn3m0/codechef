You are given two spanning trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ on the same set of $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each edge $e_1$ in $T_1$, you have to calculate the number of edges $e_2 \in T_2$ which satisfy the following conditions:
- $T_1 - e_1 + e_2$ (the graph formed by removing the edge $e_1$ from $T_1$ and adding the edge $e_2$) is a spanning tree
- $T_2 - e_2 + e_1$ is also a spanning tree

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the following $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge in $T_1$ between vertices $u$ and $v$.
- The following $N-1$ lines describe the edges of $T_2$ in the same format.

### Output
For each test case, print $N-1$ space-separated integers â€” the number of valid edges $e_2$ for each edge $e_1 \in T_1$ (in the order in which they are given on the input).

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):** the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input

### Example Output
