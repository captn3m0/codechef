He is currently in city <b>0<\/b>, and he wants to get to city <b>N<\/b>.<br \/>\nThe cities along the road from <b>0<\/b> to <b>N<\/b> are numbered <b>0, 1, 2, 3, ... N-1, N<\/b> in increasing order of distance from city <b>0<\/b>.<br \/>\nThe distance between cities <b>i<\/b> and <b>i-1<\/b> is denoted by <b>d<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>\nHowever, as is always the case, it is unsafe to travel at night, so he will have to break his journey over multiple days.<br \/>\nChef may travel at most <b>D<\/b> distance in any day, so he will have to book hotel for overnight stay in some of the cities.<br \/>\nOn any day, Chef will begin his journey from some city and end his journey at some other city.<br \/>\nChef wants to reach city <b>N<\/b> in as few days as possible, so he has to plan his trip accordingly.<br \/>\nLet <b>L<\/b> be the minimum number of days in which he can reach city <b>N<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>\nChef knows the cost of overnight stay in each city. The cost of overnight stay in city <b>i<\/b> is <b>c<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.<br \/>\nChef will need to get all his hotel bills re-embersed, and his boss might get suspicious if cost for any single day exceeds a threshold.<\/p>\n<p>\nChef knows that his boss wants him to reach as soon as possible. Thus, if it is possible for Chef to go from <b>0<\/b> to <b>N<\/b> in <b>L<\/b> days with no restriction on where Chef stays, then his boss will want him to reach in exactly <b>L<\/b> days. However, if the boss puts a threshold value <b>i<\/b> then we know that the Chef may not be able to reach in <b>L<\/b> days (since he may not be allowed to stay at some hotels). Help him him find the minimum threshold value <b>C<\/b> such that if he only stays in hotels of cost &lt;= <b>C<\/b>, it is possible for him to reach the destination <b>N<\/b> in exactly <b>L<\/b> days (remember, here <b>L<\/b> is the minimum number of days needed by Chef if there were absolutely no restrictions on where he stays).<\/p>\n<p>\nFormally, let <b>L<\/b> be the minimal number of days it takes Chef to get from city <b>0<\/b> to city <b>N<\/b>. Let <b>F(i)<\/b> be the minimal number of days it takes Chef to get from city <b>0<\/b> to city <b>N<\/b> if it's not allowed to pay more than <b>i<\/b> for a single stay in hotel. Find the smallest <b>C<\/b> that will still allow Chef to get to city <b>N<\/b> without losing time. In other words <b>F(C)=L<\/b>. Find and output <b>L<\/b> as well.<\/p>\n<p><h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
