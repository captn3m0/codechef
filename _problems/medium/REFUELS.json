At the beginning of each lap, the number of units of fuel in your car must be a positive integer that doesn't exceed the tank capacity <b>N<\/b>, and it will decrease by 1 during a lap.\nAfter each lap, you can spend <b>P<\/b> seconds to visit a pit stop and refuel your car (add some fuel).\nIt's allowed to start a lap with only 1 unit of fuel and thus finish it with 0 units \u2014 but you have to visit a pit stop right after that, unless it was the last lap of the race.\nYou can start the race with any allowed (positive integer that doesn't exceed <b>N<\/b>) number of units of fuel.<\/p>\n\n<p>The more fuel your car contains, the slower it is.\nIf you start a lap with x units of fuel, you will finish this lap in <b>t<\/b><sub>x<\/sub> seconds.\nYou can assume that <b>t<\/b><sub>x<\/sub> \u2264 <b>t<\/b><sub>x+1<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are <b>Q<\/b> independent races, each described by two integers <b>K<\/b> and <b>P<\/b>, denoting the number of laps and the time needed to visit a pit stop in that race (let's say that in some races the pit stop crew is lazy and works slower).\nFor each race, find the minimum possible number of seconds in which you can finish that race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n\n<p>The first line of the input contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>Q<\/b>, denoting the tank capacity and the number of races respectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second line contains <b>N<\/b> integers <b>t<\/b><sub>1<\/sub>, <b>t<\/b><sub>2<\/sub>, ..., <b>t<\/b><sub><b>N<\/b><\/sub>, where <b>t<\/b><sub>x<\/sub> denotes the time needed to finish a lap if you start it with x units of fuel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each of the next <b>Q<\/b> lines contains two integers <b>K<\/b> and <b>P<\/b>, denoting the number of laps and the number of seconds needed to visit a pit stop in one race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n\n<p>For each of the <b>Q<\/b> races, in a separate line, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of seconds needed to finish the race.\nPlease note the unusual constraint about the answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N<\/b>, <b>Q<\/b> \u2264 300,000<\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264\u00a0<b>K<\/b>, <b>P<\/b>, <b>t<\/b><sub>i<\/sub> \u2264 10<sup>13<\/sup><\/li>\n<li><b>t<\/b><sub>i<\/sub> \u2264 <b>t<\/b><sub>i+1<\/sub><\/li>\n<li>It's guaranteed that the answer fits in the signed 64-bit type.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n3 14\n5 7 20\n5 60\n5 3\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n7 60\n999999999 60\n1000 123456789123\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n104\n35\n5\n5\n5\n11\n12\n12\n17\n19\n20\n176\n30666666576\n41111110788607<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n\n<p>Your car fits up to <b>N<\/b> = 3 units of fuel.\nLet's take a look at the first two races.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Race #1.<\/b>  This race consists of <b>K<\/b> = 5 laps and you need <b>P<\/b> = 60 seconds to visit a pit stop.\nOne optimal scenario is:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start the race with 3 units of fuel.<\/li>\n<li>Spend <b>t<\/b><sub>3<\/sub> = 20 seconds on the first lap.
