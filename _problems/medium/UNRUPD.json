This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le N \\le 2\\times10^5$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 3\\times10^5$\n- $0 \\le A_i \\le 2^{30}-1$\n- For queries of type $1$ and $2$, $1 \\le L \\le R \\le N$\n- For queries of type $3$, $1 \\le x \\le N$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Given an array $A$ of length $N$, you have to perform $Q$ queries on it. \n\nThere are three different type of queries:\n\n- $1$ $L$ $R$ - For every $i$ such that $L \\le i \\le R$ and $A_i \\gt 0$, replace $A_i$ with $A_i$ $|$ $(A_i-1)$.\n- $2$ $L$ $R$ - For every $i$ such that $L \\le i \\le R$ and $A_i \\gt 0$, replace $A_i$ with $A_i$ $\\&amp;$ $(A_i-1)$.\n- $3$ $x$ - Print $A_x$.\n\nOutput the answer to each query of type $3$.","inputFormat":"- The first line contains $2$ integers, $N$ and $Q$ - the number of elements in the array $A$ and the number of queries, respectively.\n- The next line contains $N$ integers - $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\ldots$, $A_N$, the elements of the array $A$.\n- $i$-th line of the next $Q$ lines contains the description of the $i$-th query.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each query of type $3$, output the value of $A_x$.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"3 7\n1 2 3\n2 2 3\n3 2\n3 3\n1 1 3\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3","output":"0\n2\n1\n0\n3","explanation":"Initially, $A = [1,2,3]$\n- Query $1$: $A$ becomes $[1, 2$ $\\&amp;$ $(2-1), 3$ $\\&amp;$ $(3-1)] = [1, 0, 2]$.\n- Query $2$: The value of $A_2 = 0$.\n- Query $3$: The value of $A_3 = 2$.\n- Query $4$: $A$ becomes $[1, 0, 2$ $|$ $(2-1)] = [1, 0, 3]$.\n- Query $5$: The value of $A_1 = 1$.\n- Query $6$: The value of $A_2 = 0$.\n- Query $7$: The value of $A_3 = 3$.\n","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"4","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"mohammed200218","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>mohammed200218<\/span>","problem_tester":"tabr","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #D0011B;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>7&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>tabr<\/span>","date_added":"24-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/mohammed200218'>mohammed200218<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"","time":{"view_start_date":1642957200,"submit_start_date":1642957200,"visible_start_date":1642957200,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797987},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=UNRUPD","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
