In an undirected weighted graph, we define an $s - t$ *mincut cost* as the minimum sum of weights of edges which have to be removed from the graph so that there would be no path between vertices $s$ and $t$. 

You are given a two-dimensional array $A$ with size $N \times N$. You are allowed to increase the value of each element of this array by any non-negative integer (these integers may be different for different elements). Afterwards, the array $A$ should satisfy the following condition: there is a graph $G$ with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$) such that for each $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le N$), the $i-j$ mincut cost in $G$ is equal to $A_{ij}$.

Let's define the *cost* of the above operation as the sum of all integers added to elements of the initial array $A$. Compute the minimum possible cost.

**Note that: We consider only non-negative weight graphs.**

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{i1}, A_{i2}, \dots, A_{iN}$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum cost.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $0 \le A_{ij} \le 10^9$ for each valid $i, j$
- $A_{ii} = 0$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $A_{ij} \le 1$ for each valid $i, j$

**Subtask #2 (40 points):** $N \le 100$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Output

```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Of course, we must increase $A_{12}$ by $1$, since $A_{21} = 1$. This is sufficient; one possible graph $G$ is shown in the picture below. (Disconnecting vertices $1$ and $2$ costs $1$.)

**Example case 2:** Similarly, we must increase $A_{12}$ by $1$, $A_{31}$ by $1$ and $A_{32}$ also by $1$. This is again sufficient and a possible graph $G$ is shown in the picture below. (Disconnecting vertices $1$ and $2$ costs $1$, disconnecting vertices $1, 3$ costs $3$ and disconnecting $2, 3$ costs $1$.)
