However, he has ran out of funds to buy new weapons and must somehow earn a large amount money to fund his revenge and buy guns. \n\n\nHe decides to rob the Bank of Wasseypur to get the funds, his friend has a friend who works as a security guard and has told him the secret of the banks safe. The manager of the bank is a big fan of puzzles and is currently fascinated with bits. The manager takes a number and writes it out in binary format with $K$ bits, he then rearranges the bits of the number anyway he likes. Recently he has also started experimenting with the bitwise XOR operation. As such he has come upon a very ingenious way of determining the code of the bank's safe.\n\n\nEach day he takes two numbers L and R. He then considers all the numbers between $L$ and $R$, inclusive and sets the safe's code as the number of ways he can rearrange the bits in these numbers such that the bitwise XOR of all these numbers is maximum. Since the safe code can only have 10 digits, he divides the this number by 1000000007 and uses the remainder as the code.\n\n\nAfter some bribery, the guard has also given Faizal a list of $L$, $R$ and $K$, that the manager could have used to make the secret code. Can you help Faizal get the secret code for all of them?\n\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 30$\n- $2 \\leq L \\lt R \\lt 2^K$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"After Danish's death, Faizal wants to take revenge against Ramadhir.

The manager takes a number and writes it out in binary format with $K$ bits. He then rearranges the bits of the number however he likes. Recently, he has also started experimenting with the [bitwise XOR] (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exclusive_or) operation. This led him to come up with the following way of setting the code of the bank's safe:\n\nEach day he takes two numbers $L$ and $R$. He then considers all the numbers between $L$ and $R$, both endpoints included. The safe's code is set as the number of ways he can rearrange the bits in these numbers such that the bitwise XOR of all the resulting numbers is maximum. Since the safe code can only have upto $10$ digits, he divides the this number by $10^9 +7$ and uses the remainder as the code.\n\nAfter some bribery, the guard has also given Faizal a list of $L$, $R$ and $K$, that the manager could have used to make the secret code.
