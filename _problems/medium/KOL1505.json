{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"KOL1505","problem_name":"Jalebi Bai and Decks of Sweets","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p>Jalebi Bai has two decks of sweets. These decks are represented by two strings <b>s<\/b> and <b>t<\/b> consisting of lowercase letters from the English alphabet. Each letter from 'a' to 'z' denotes a single type of sweet, e.g., \u2018b\u2019 denotes Barfi, 'r' denotes Rasgulla, etc. She wants to use these decks in her friend Laddu\u2019s marriage. Instead of graciously accepting the gift, Laddu asks Jalebi Bai to first make the two decks exactly the same, so that they look good while serving. Now Jalebi Bai can apply the following operation as many times as she wants on both the decks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nFrom a single deck, pick any two consecutive sweets of the same type and eat one of them. e.g., if a deck is \"rrrjj\", she can change it to \"rrrj\" by picking the last two sweets of type 'j' (Jalebi) and eating one of them, or she can change the deck to \"rrjj\" by  picking up the first two sweets of type \u2018r\u2019 and eating one of them.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nYou need to tell whether Jalebi Bai can make the decks equal by applying the above operation as many times as she wants. Output \"Yes\" [without quotes] if she can, otherwise output \"No\" [without quotes].\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
