### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/mandarin/ABCD0825.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/russian/ABCD0825.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME99/vietnamese/ABCD0825.pdf) as well.

**This is an interactive problem.**

There are four hidden integers $A,B,C,D$ ($1 \le A,B,C,D \le 10^9$). Your goal is to find out if $A \cdot B$ is greater, equal to or smaller than $C \cdot D$.

To do that, you are allowed to ask up to $Q$ queries. In each query:
- You should choose integers $a, b, c, d$ between $-10^9$ and $10^9$ inclusive.
- Let $X = a \cdot A + b \cdot B + c \cdot C + d \cdot D$.
- You are told whether $X \gt 0$, $X = 0$ or $X \lt 0$.

Note that the scoring for subtask 2 is linear. Please read the scoring function in the section Subtasks.
