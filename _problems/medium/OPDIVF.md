The [Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) states that every number can be represented uniquely by its prime factorization, which is the decomposition of the number into the product of its prime powers.

Formally, the prime factorization of a number $N = p_1^{q_1} \times p_2^{q_2} \times p_3^{q_3} \dots \times p_m^{q_m}$, where $p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_m$ are the prime factors, and $q_1, q_2, q_3, \dots, q_m$ are the corresponding exponents, such that $p_i^{q_i}$ is the largest power of the prime $p_i$ that divides $N$.

You're given the prime factorization of a number $N$. You need to process $Q$ queries. In each query, you will be given a positive integer $K$. Let's call a divisor, $D$ of $N$ **overpowered** relative to $K$ if the sum of exponents in the prime factorization of $D$ equals to $K$. 

More formally, if $D = p_1^{r_1} \times p_2^{r_2} \times p_3^{r_3} \dots \times p_m^{r_m}$, then $D$ is an overpowered divisor of $N$ relative to $K$ iff it divides $N$ and $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \dots + r_m = K$.

You need to print the sum of each **distinct** overpowered divisor of $N$ relative to $K$ modulo $998244353$.
