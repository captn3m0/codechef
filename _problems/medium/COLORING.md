Chef has recently learnt about binary trees and immediately fell in love with them. His best friend Shasha has promised him to gift a binary tree only if he is able to show his love for binary trees by solving the following problem about binary trees.

Given a complete binary tree **T** consisting of **N** nodes labelled from 1 to **N**. The node with label **1** is the root of the tree. For a node labelled **v**, its' left child will be labelled as **2\*v** (provided it exists) and right child as **2\*v+1** (provided it exists).

Initially, all the nodes of tree are uncolored.

Chef has to perform **Q** queries on tree **T** where each query can have one of the following three types:

- **1 X K**Update the tree **T** such that node **X** becomes uncolored, all the nodes at distance **1** from **X** get colored with color **1**, all nodes at distance **2** from **X** get colored with color **2**, and so on up to nodes at distance **K** from **X**.
    
    Formally, color all nodes that are at distance **(1 ≤ D ≤ K)** units from node **X** with color **D** and make node **X** colourless.
    
    Please note that when we say node at distance **D** from node **X**, *you have to consider all the nodes in the tree, not just the ones in the subtree of **X***.
- **2 X Y**Count the number of distinct colors on the unique simple path from node **X** to node **Y**.
- **3 X**Count the number of distinct colors in the subtree rooted at node **X**.

### Input

The first line of input contains two space separated integer numbers **N** and **Q** denoting the number of nodes in the tree **T** and number of queries to be processed respectively.

Each of the following **Q** lines contains a query of one of the above mentioned three types.

### Output

For each query of type **2** and **3**, print the sought answer.

### Constraints

- **1 ≤ N ≤ 105**
- **1 ≤ Q ≤ 50000**
- **1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N**
- **0 ≤ K ≤ 105**

### Subtasks

- Subtask 1 (32 pts) : **1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1000**
- Subtask 2 (68 pts) : **original constraints**
