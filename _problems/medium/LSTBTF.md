### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/hindi/LSTBTF.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/bengali/LSTBTF.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/mandarin/LSTBTF.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/russian/LSTBTF.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV19/vietnamese/LSTBTF.pdf) as well.

Let's call a positive integer $M$ a *beautiful number* if the following conditions are satisfied:
- The decimal representation of $M$ (without leading zeros) does not contain any zeros.
- The sum of squares of all decimal digits of $M$ is a perfect square.

For example, $1$, $4$ and $221$ are beautiful, but $10$ and $333$ are not.

You are given a positive integer $N$. Find the smallest $N$-digit beautiful number or determine that all $N$-digit integers are not beautiful.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest $N$-digit beautiful number, or $-1$ if there is no such number.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $1 \le N \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** $1 \le T \le 10$

### Example Input
```
2
1
2
```

### Example Output
```
1
34
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** It is obvious that $1$ is the smallest beautiful number.

**Example case 2:** $34$ is beautiful because $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$. On the other hand, we can prove that this is the smallest beautiful number.
