{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"HKRMAN","problem_name":"Hackerman","body":"Hacker-man's crew is trying to get into Swiss bank's locker, but in order to do so, hacker-man has to bypass a really tough laser lock.\r\n\r\nHe can see a square matrix with $N$ rows and $N$ columns. Inside it, he sees $K$ lasers in fixed coordinates. Each laser can be oriented vertically or horizontally, but not both. If placed horizontally, a laser will light up all cells in its row with distance at most $d$ from the laser's cell. If placed vertically, it will light up all cells in its column with distance at most $d$ from the laser's cell. A laser always lights up its own cell, so the number of cells it will light up is always $2d+1$ (including the ones lit outside the matrix).\r\n\r\nHacker-man can choose the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of each laser.\r\n\r\nIn order to bypass the lock, the lasers should be in such a configuration that no cell in the matrix is lit up by more than one laser. You should find one such configuration, or report that it is impossible.\r\n\r\n###Input\r\n- The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \r\n- For every test case:\r\n\t- The first line contains three space-separated integers, $N$, $d$, and $K$, where $N$ is the length of one side of the square matrix, $d$ is the maximum reach of a laser, and $K$ is the number of lasers.\r\n\t- Each of the next $K$ lines contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ denoting the coordinates of the $i$-th laser, where $x_i$ is the distance from the left edge and $y_i$ is the distance from the bottom edge.\r\n\r\n**Note:** No two lasers are at the same coordinates\r\n\r\n###Output\r\nFor each test case, print \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes) depending on whether a configuration as described in the question is possible or not. If a configuration is possible, then in the next line print $K$ space-separated integers representing the orientations of the $K$ lasers respectively ($0$ for vertical and $1$ for horizontal)\r\n\r\n**Case is sensitive.
