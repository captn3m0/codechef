<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3>
<p>A small group of archaeologists is working in the Antarctic. Their sensors have detected a number of caves in which there are interesting fossils. However, a thick layer of ice blocks the entrance to each cave. The archaeologists possess the equipment needed to burn a tunnel in the layer of ice, but the fuel is extremely expensive. In order to determine the size of each fossil the group has launched a number of probes through small bore-holes. </p>
<p>Each probe which hits a fossil emits a signal consisting of its x and y coordinates. Your task is to determine the smallest possible size of the tunnel, which is equal to the maximum distance between any two probes (so that the fossil won&#8217;t be damaged during extraction). The drilling equipment requiers the squared value of this distance.</p>
<p>Given a list of coordinates of points containing probes, find the square of the maximum distance between any two probes. </p>
