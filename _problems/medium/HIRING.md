Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami's paper "Fast Food Times".

$N$ candidates (numbered $1$ through $N$) have applied for the job. There are $M$ traits that define how good a chef is. You are given $N$ strings $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$ describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length $M$. For each valid $i$ and $j$, the $j$-th character of $S_i$ is '1' if the $i$-th chef has the $j$-th trait or '0' if this chef does not have this trait.

Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence $H$ (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence $(1, 2, \ldots, N)$ and hire all candidates from $H$. However, the sequence $H$ must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of $H$ (let's denote them by $x$ and $y$), candidates $x$ and $y$ have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.

Now, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string $S_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of valid subsequences modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le M \le 16$
- $1 \le N \le 100,000$
- $|S_i| = M$ for each valid $i$
- $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_M$ contain only characters '0' and '1'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $500,000$

### Example Input
```
1
4 2
10
01
11
10
```

### Example Output
```
7
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The valid subsequences are $(1)$, $(2)$, $(3)$, $(4)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$ and $(1,2,4)$.
