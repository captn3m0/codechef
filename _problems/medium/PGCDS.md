### Read problems statements in [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK133/russian/PGCDS.pdf).

We define the *GCD set* of an array $A$ of length $N$ as the set containing the GCD of all prefixes of $A$. More formally, the GCD set $G$ of $A$ contains the values $\gcd([A_1]), \gcd([A_1, A_2]), \gcd([A_1, A_2, A_3]), \ldots, \gcd([A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n])$, where $\gcd(B)$ is the largest integer $d$ such that all the numbers in array $B$ are divisible by $d$. Note that **all values in $G$ are distinct**.

For example, $\gcd([6]) = 6$, $\gcd([6, 12]) = 6$, $\gcd([6, 12, 9]) = 3$, and $\gcd([6, 12, 9, 2]) = 1$. Therefore, the GCD set of the array $[6, 12, 9, 2]$ is $\{1, 3, 6\}$.

You are given an integer set $S$ of size $M$ and two integers $N, MOD$, where $MOD$ is a prime. You need to calculate the probability that the GCD set of $P$ is equal to $S$, where $P$ is a **permutation** of values $1$ to $N$ chosen uniformly randomly.

It can be shown that the answer is in the form of $\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime non-negative integers and $Q \neq 0$. You need to find the value $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{MOD}$.
