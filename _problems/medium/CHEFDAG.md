You are given $K$ permutations of integers $1$ through $N$. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le K$), the $i$-th permutation is denoted by $A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \ldots, A_{i,N}$.

Construct a directed acyclic graph with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$) such that:
- Each of the given permutations is a valid topological sort of the graph. Formally, for each valid $k$ and each $i, j$ ($1 \le i \lt j \le N$), there is no edge from the node $A_{k,j}$ to the node $A_{k,i}$.
- The outdegree of each node is at most $1$.
- The number of nodes with indegree $0$ is the smallest possible.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- $K$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le K$), the $i$-th of these lines contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \ldots, A_{i,N}$.

### Output
For each test case, print two lines.
- The first of these lines should contain one integer â€• the minimum number of nodes with indegree $0$.
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N$ describing your graph in the following way: for each valid $i$, if $v_i = 0$, there is no outgoing edge from the $i$-th node; otherwise, there is an edge from the $i$-th node to the $v_i$-th node.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 500$
- $1 \le K \le 100$
- $1 \le A_{i,j} \le N$ for each valid $i,j$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):**
- $N \le 20$
- $K \le 10$

**Subtask #2 (80 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
2 2
1 2
2 1
2 2
1 2
1 2
```

### Example Output
```
2
0 0
1
2 0
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The graph must consist of just two disconnected nodes, since no edges are allowed. Hence, there are two nodes with indegree $0$.

**Example case 2:** The graph may contain an edge from node $1$ to node $2$. Then, there is only one node with indegree $0$.
