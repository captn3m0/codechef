###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

Let us calculate the sum of k-th powers of natural numbers from 1 to n. As the result can be quite large, output the result modulo some integer p.

### Input

First t<=10 - the number of test cases. Each test case consist of numbers: 1<=n<=1000000000, 1<=k<=100, 1<=p<=1000000000.

### Output

For each test case, output the value: (1k+2k+...+nk) mod p.

### Example

For input:

```
4
10 1 1000000
10 2 1000000
10 3 1000000
10 4 1000000

```
the correct output is:

```
55
385
3025
25333

```
