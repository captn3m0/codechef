One day, while studying in a library, he found a pattern $P$ in a century old book. The pattern is a string of lowercase English letters, with length $M$. Since Zawad is a curious boy, he started experimenting with the pattern.\n\nIn one experiment, Zawad considers all $26^N$ strings with length $N$ that contain only lowercase English letters. The strings are numbered $0$ through $26^N - 1$ in lexicographical order. For each valid $i$, let $C_i$ be the length of the longest prefix of $P$ which is also a suffix of the $i$-th of these strings ($0 \\le C_i \\le M$).\n\nFor each integer $k$ between $0$ and $M$ inclusive, let $S_k$ denote the sum of all valid indices $i$ such that $C_i = k$. Zawad wants to know all these sums, but since they could be huge, it is enough to compute them modulo $998,244,353$.\n\nSince Zawad is a bit busy at the library, he is asking for your help. Can you find the sums and earn Zawad's respect?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $M$ and $N$.\n- The second line contains a single string $P$ with length $M$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $M+1$ space-separated integers $S_0, S_1, \\ldots, S_M$ \u2014 the sums modulo $998,244,353$.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 5$\n- $1 \\le M \\le 10^5$\n- $M \\le N \\le 10^6$\n- $P$ contains only lowercase English letters\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n1 1\na\n3 5\nnan\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n325 0\n555099525 502507217 596119576 22936464\n```\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK107\/hindi\/IDXSUM.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK107\/mandarin\/IDXSUM.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK107\/russian\/IDXSUM.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK107\/vietnamese\/IDXSUM.pdf), and [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/COOK107\/bengali\/IDXSUM.pdf) as well.\n\nZawad is a rare competitive programmer \u2014 he takes his studies seriously.
