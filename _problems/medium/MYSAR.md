**This is an interactive problem.**

Joshua is hiding a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$, where $N$ is even. He wants to play a game with you. Your goal is to guess the sequence.

First, Joshua tells you $A_1$ and $A_N$. Then, you should ask him queries. In each query, you choose four integers $L_1$, $R_1$, $L_2$ and $R_2$ such that $1 \le L_1 \lt R_1 \le N$ and $1 \le L_2 \lt R_2 \le N$, and Joshua's answer is the maximum of $A_{L_1}, A_{L_1+1}, \ldots, A_{R_1}$ minus the minimum of $A_{L_2}, A_{L_2+1}, \ldots, A_{R_2}$.

Can you find the sequence using no more than $2N$ queries?

### Interaction
- First, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers $N$, $A_1$ and $A_N$.
- Then you may ask queries. To ask a query:
    - Print a line containing the character 'Q' followed by a space and four space-separated integers $L_1$, $R_1$, $L_2$ and $R_2$.
    - Then, read a line containing one integer â€• the answer to the query.
- When you think you know the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!' followed by a space and $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ describing your guess.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

### Constraints
- $2 \le N \le 10^5$
- $N$ is even
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

### Example
```
You                         Grader
                            4 1 1
Q 1 2 3 4
                            1
Q 3 4 1 3
                            2
! 1 2 3 1
```

### Explanation
Joshua has the sequence $[1, 2, 3, 1]$.

For the first query, the maximum of $A_1, A_2$ is $2$ and the minimum of $A_3, A_4$ is $1$, so the answer to this query is $2 - 1 = 1$.

For the second query, the maximum of $A_3, A_4$ is $3$ and the minimum of $A_1, A_3$ is $1$, so the answer is $3 - 1 = 2$.

Finally, we correctly guess the sequence by printing "! 1 2 3 1".
