### Read problems statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK122/hindi/BRBAL.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK122/mandarin/BRBAL.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK122/russian/BRBAL.pdf), [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK122/vietnamese/BRBAL.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK122/bengali/BRBAL.pdf) as well.

Two of your friends (let's denote them by $P$ and $Q$) are playing a game and you are acting as their dealer. The rules of the game are as follows:
- There are $N$ bracket sequences, denoted by $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$.
- Initially, both players do not have any sequences. They play up to $N$ turns. For each valid $i$, in the $i$-th turn, you have to choose one player and give the bracket sequence $S_i$ to this player.
- After each turn, if it is possible to arrange **all** the sequences of one player in some order and concatenate them in such a way that the resulting bracket sequence is non-empty and *balanced*, that player immediately wins and the game ends. Note that it is impossible for both players to form non-empty balanced sequences at the same time.

You like $P$ more and hence want $P$ to win. Find the smallest number of turns you need in order to make $P$ win or determine that it is impossible to achieve this.

Notes:
- A bracket sequence is an arbitrary string containing only characters '(' and ')'.
- A balanced bracket sequence is one of the following:
    - An empty string.
    - A concatenation of two non-empty balanced bracket sequences.
    - A string formed by adding '(' to the beginning and ')' to the end of a balanced bracket sequence.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string $S_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest number of turns needed to make $P$ win or $-1$ if it is impossible.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 15$
- $1 \le N \le 200$
- $1 \le |S_i| \le 200$ for each valid $i$

### Example Input
```
1
4
())
((
()))
()((
```

### Example Output
```
3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** You can give $S_1$ to $Q$ and $S_2$ and $S_3$ to $P$.
