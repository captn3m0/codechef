Chef likes sequences of integers and in particular, he likes arithmetic progressions.

There are two integers $N$ and $K$. Chef wants to choose a starting positive integer $A$, create the sequence $(A, A+K, A + 2 \cdot K, \ldots, A + (N-1) \cdot K)$ and compute the product of all elements of this sequence; let's denote this product by $X$. For example, if $N=3$ and $K=2$, then Chef can create the sequence $(4,6,8)$, for which $X=192$.

Find the largest integer that divides $X$ regardless of the value of $A$ that Chef chooses. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the largest number that always divides $X$, modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$
- $1 \le K \le 10^{18}$

### Example Input
```
2
2 2
3 1
```

### Example Output
```
1
6
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** If Chef chooses $A=1$, the sequence he creates is $(1,3)$ and then, $X$ is $3$, and if he chooses $A=2$, the sequence is $(2,4)$ and $X$ is $8$. We can see that the largest integer that divides them both is $1$.

**Example case 2:** The product of any $3$ consecutive integers is always divisible by $6$.
