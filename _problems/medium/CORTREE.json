The coronavirus has spread all over the world and unfortunately, Arya is infected too.\r\n\r\nThe government is trying to defeat this virus. Their scientists made a medicine which can be used to cure parts of the country. We know that there is an integer $k$ with the following meaning: for each city $v$, if we give the medicine to people in this city, then this city and all cities in its subtree such that their distance from $v$ is at most $k$ become cured.
