This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le T \\le 1000$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 200\\,000$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le N$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $200\\,000$.\n- $A_i \\ne A_j$ for $i \\ne j$\n- Initially $A$ doesn't contain consecutive monotone triples.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (50 points):** The sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5000$.\n**Subtask 2 (50 points):** No additional constraints.","subtasksState":true,"statement":"You are given an array $A$ of length $N$, which initially is a permutation of integers from $1$ to $N$.\n\nWe want to make the array empty by performing the following operation $N$ times: choose any index $i$ and remove $A_i$ from $A$, which decrements the size of $A$ by $1$. \n\nWe will perform exactly $N$ such operations.
