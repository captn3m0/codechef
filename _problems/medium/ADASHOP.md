Ada has the biggest chessboard in ChefLand. It has $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$), where $M \ge 2N$. As training for her upcoming world chess championship match, she placed one bishop at row $r$ and column $c$ of her board. The remaining squares of the board are empty. Now, she is calculating the number of squares that can be reached by the bishop in at most $K$ moves. Help Ada verify her answers.

Remember that in one move, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)">bishop</a> at row $r$ and column $c$ can move to another square at row $r'$ and column $c'$ if and only if either $r+c=r'+c'$ or $r-c=r'-c'$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $r$, $c$ and $K$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of reachable squares.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 5 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le N, K \le 10^9$
- $2N \le M \le 10^9$
- $1 \le r \le N$
- $1 \le c \le M$

### Example Input
