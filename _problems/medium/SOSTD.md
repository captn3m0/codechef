Hussain really likes problems that involve summation over X, where X can be subsets, paths in a tree, intervals of numbers etc.

You are given two integer sequences $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_N$ and $B_1, B_2, B_3, \ldots, B_N$. Consider an arbitrary non-empty subset $S$ of the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$. Let's define the *swagness* of such a set as
$$\left(\mathrm{max}_{(p \in S)} \; A_p\right) \cdot \left(\mathrm{max}_{(p \in S)} \; B_p\right) \,.$$

Hussain is interested in the sum of swagnesses of all possible sets $S$. (Note that there are $2^N-1$ such sets.) Since the sum may be very large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_N$.
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, B_3, \ldots, B_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the total swagness modulo $10^9+7$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i, B_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Example Input
```
1
3
1 2 3
6 5 4
```

### Example Output
```
91
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The answer is $1 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6$.
