### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/MATPERM.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/MATPERM.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/MATPERM.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/MATPERM.pdf) as well.

There is a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns. There are $K$ cannons (numbered $1$ through $K$) placed in $K$ cells of this grid. Each cannon can fire a ball to any cell whose Manhattan distance from the cannon does not exceed the strength of the cannon (including the cell with the cannon). Initially (at the $0$-th second), the strengths of all the cannons are $0$ and they increase by $1$ every second. Starting at the $0$-th second, cannons start throwing balls according to the following rules: 

- At each second, exactly one cannon fires one ball to a cell which does not contain any balls yet. (Note that at least one such cell exists for each cannon unless the grid is full.)
- The same cannon may fire during multiple seconds.
- When a ball is fired by a cannon at the $i$-th second, the number $i$ gets printed on the cell the ball lands in.

At the end of the $N \cdot M - 1$ th second, the grid will be representing a permutation of the integers $0$ through $N \cdot M - 1$. (Two permutations $P_1$ and $P_2$ are different if at least one cell has different numbers printed on it in $P_1$ and $P_2$.)

A permutation is considered to be *good* if it can be formed at the end of the $N \cdot M - 1$ 
th second in the given process.

Your task is to find the fraction of permutations that are good, i.e. the number of good permutations divided by the number of all permutations of $0$ through $N \cdot M - 1$. Let's denote this fraction by $P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are positive integers and $Q$ is coprime with $2,500,000,001$. You should compute $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $2,500,000,001$, where $Q^{-1}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse of $Q$ modulo $2,500,000,001$.

**Note:** The Manhattan distance between a cell in row $r_1$ and column $c_1$ and a cell in row $r_2$ and column $c_2$ is $|r_1-r_2| + |c_1-c_2|$.
