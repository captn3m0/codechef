**This is an interactive problem.**

Sushi has a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$; each of them is between $1$ and $10^6$ inclusive. You do not know this sequence, but for a strange reason (maybe because you love her!), you have to find it.

You may ask up to $2,222$ queries. In each query:
- You should choose two integers $K$ and $X$ ($1 \le K \le N + 1$, $1 \le X \le 10^6$).
- Sushi creates a new sequence $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{N+1}$, where $B_K = X$ and if we deleted the element $B_K$ from this sequence, we would obtain the sequence $A$.
- Then, Sushi tells you the number of inversions in the sequence $B$, i.e. the number of pairs $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i \lt j \le N + 1$ and $B_i \gt B_j$.

### Interaction
- First, you should read a line containing a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.
- For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer $N$.
- To ask a query, you should print a line containing the character '?', followed by a space and two space-separated integers $K$ and $X$ describing your query. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer â€• the answer to the query.
- When you have guessed the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!', followed by a space and $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ ($1 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$). This does not count as a query.

If you ask more than $2,222$ queries or do not follow the interaction format, you may receive any verdict.

**Do not forget to flush the output after printing each line!**

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 20$
- $1 \le N \le 100$

### Example Input
```
You             Sushi
                2
                2
? 1 1
                1
? 2 4
                2
? 2 2
                3
? 3 4
                1
! 3 1
                1
? 1 5
                1
? 1 4
                0
! 4
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The sequence Sushi has is $A = [3, 1]$. Your interaction with Sushi is as follows:
- `? 1 1`: Sushi creates the sequence $B = [1, 3, 1]$ and returns the number of inversions in it, which is $1$.
- `? 2 4`: Sushi creates the sequence $B = [3, 4, 1]$ and returns the number of inversions in it, which is $2$.
- `? 2 2`: Sushi creates the sequence $B = [3, 2, 1]$ and returns the number of inversions in it, which is $3$.
- `? 3 4`: Sushi creates the sequence $B = [3, 1, 4]$ and returns the number of inversions in it, which is $1$.
- `! 3 1`: You have guessed the sequence to be $[3, 1]$, which is correct.
