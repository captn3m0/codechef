###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

 For two given sequences of integers, find the longest possible integer sequence which is a subsequence of both these sequences, and whose elements are integers in a (strictly) increasing order.

### Input

 The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), the length of the first sequence.

 The next n integers are elements of the first sequence.

 The next is m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000), the length of the second sequence.

 The next m integers are elements of the second sequence.

### Output

One number k, the length of the longest possible common subsequence that is increasing, followed by exactly k space-separated integers containing any exemplary sequence of this length.

### Example

For the input:

```
5
2 3 1 4 0
6
10 3 4 1 0 0

```
the unique correct answer is: ```
2
3 4
```
