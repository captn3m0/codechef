You are given a tree with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$). 

The distance $d(p,q)$ between two nodes $p$ and $q$ of the tree is the number of edges on the unique path between them.

There will be $Q$ events each of which can be of the following three types:

- <tt>'1 u'</tt>: A certain node $u$ becomes a special node. It is guaranteed that $u$ was not special before this event.

- <tt>'2 u'</tt>: A certain node $u$ becomes no longer special. It is guaranteed that $u$ was special before this event.

- <tt>'3 K'</tt>: You are given a non-negative integer $K$. For a node $x$, define $f(x)=\max\{ d(x,y):y\text{ is special}\}$. You must answer if there exists a node $x$ such that $f(x)=K$. In other words, you are asked whether there exists a node $x$ whose distance to the farthest special node is $K$. Note that $x$ doesn't have to be special. It is guaranteed that there is at least one special node in the tree at the time of this event.

In the beginning, there are no special nodes.
