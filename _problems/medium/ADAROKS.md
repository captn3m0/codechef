<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problems statements in [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK102/hindi/ADAROKS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK102/mandarin/ADAROKS.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK102/russian/ADAROKS.pdf), [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK102/vietnamese/ADAROKS.pdf) and [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK102/bengali/ADAROKS.pdf) as well.

After successfully defending her title of World Chess Champion, Ada noticed that she is lacking in rook endgames.

To improve her endgame skills, Ada placed $K$ kings on a chessboard with $N$ rows and $M$ columns, and now she is calculating the minimum number of rooks she must place on the board to satisfy the following conditions:
- No king is attacked by a rook.
- The kings are isolated, i.e. no king can reach another king without passing through a square attacked by a rook or capturing a rook.

Help Ada check her answers.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The next $N$ lines describe the chessboard. Each of these lines contains a string with length $M$ describing one row, where an empty square and a square containing a king are denoted by '.' and 'K' respectively.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum required number of rooks, or $-1$ if it is impossible to place rooks in a way that satisfies all conditions.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 1,024$
- $1 \le N, M \le 1,024$
- each string contains only characters '.' and 'K'
- the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,024$

### Example Input
```
1
8 8
........
........
..K.....
......K.
........
........
.K..K...
........
```

### Example Output
```
1
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** One possible position for the only necessary rook is depicted in the following image.
