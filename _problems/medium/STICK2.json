The only subsets from which we can create a polygon are $\\{2, 3, 4\\}$ and $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. On the other hand, we cannot choose e.g. $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ because degenerate polygons are not allowed.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME79\/hindi\/STICK2.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME79\/bengali\/STICK2.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME79\/mandarin\/STICK2.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME79\/russian\/STICK2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/LTIME79\/vietnamese\/STICK2.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\nCreatnx, a 7-year-old child, is playing with $7$ sticks with lengths $1, 2, \\ldots, 7$, which can be connected together.
