<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problems statements in [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/russian/SPECTAC.pdf), [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/vietnamese/SPECTAC.pdf), [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/hindi/SPECTAC.pdf), [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/mandarin/SPECTAC.pdf) and [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/bengali/SPECTAC.pdf) as well.

In between cooking lunch and dinner, Chef has decided to take some time off to read about the [Activity Selection Problem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_selection_problem). In that problem, there are $M$ time intervals $[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_M, r_M]$. A solution to the problem is a maximum subset of these intervals such that no two intervals from this subset have a common point (sharing an endpoint is also forbidden), i.e. a set containing the maximum possible number of such intervals.

Since solving this problem proved to be too easy, Chef is now wondering: in how many ways could he pick a set of $M$ distinct intervals such that all of their endpoints belong to the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ and the number of intervals in the solution to the Activity Selection Problem for this set is exactly $K$? Since the result may be very large, compute it modulo $MOD$.

### Input
The first and only line of the input contains four space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $MOD$.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of sets of intervals which satisfy all constraints, modulo $MOD$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le K \le N \le 50$
- $1 \le M \le \mathrm{min}(50, N(N + 1)/2)$
- $100 \le MOD \le 10^9 + 7$
- $MOD$ is a prime

### Example Input
```
2 2 1 997
```

### Example Output
```
2
```

### Explanation
There are exactly two possible ways to pick the intervals:
- $[1, 1]$ and $[1, 2]$
- $[2, 2]$ and $[1, 2]$

### Example Input
```
2 2 2 997
```

### Example Output
```
1
```

### Explanation
We must pick intervals $[1, 1]$ and $[2, 2]$.

### Example Input
```
30 25 20 997
```

### Example Output
```
687
```
