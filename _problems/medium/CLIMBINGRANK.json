This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1\\le t\\le 5000$\n- $1\\le m\\le n\\le 5000$\n- The sum of $n$ over all test cases is at most $5000$.\n- The array $s_1, s_2,\\dots, s_n$ is a permutation of $1,2,\\dots, n$.\n- The array $b_1, b_2,\\dots, b_n$ is a permutation of $1,2,\\dots, n$.\n- $1\\le l_i\\le n$ for all $i=1,2,\\dots, m$.\n- $l_i\\neq l_j$ for all $1\\le i\\lt j\\le m$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/mandarin\/CLIMBINGRANK.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/russian\/CLIMBINGRANK.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/vietnamese\/CLIMBINGRANK.pdf) as well.\n\nThere are $n$ climbers, numbered $1, 2,\\dots, n$, taking part in the sport climbing final at the olympic games and you are a fan of athlete $1$.\n\nA climbing competition features three contests, one for each discipline: speed, bouldering, and lead.\n\nFor each of the three disciplines, all the $n$ athletes compete in the respective contest and they are ranked, depending on their performance, from $1$-st to $n$-th (there are no ties).\n\nAt the end, the score of each athlete is the product of his three ranking positions.\nThe final ranking is obtained ordering, nondecreasingly, athletes by score (e.g., the winner is the one with the smallest score).\nTo take care of equal scores, we say that an athlete has final ranking equal to $r$ if there are exactly $r-1$ other athletes with a strictly smaller score (notice that distinct athletes may have the same final ranking).\n\nCurrently the competition is ongoing. The speed and bouldering contests have finished, but only some athletes have taken part in the lead contest so the ranking for the lead is partial (i.e., only some athletes are ranked and their ranking may change as other athletes still have to compete). For example, if $n=3$ and the current lead ranking is $[3, 1]$ (athlete $3$ is first, athlete $1$ is second, athlete $2$ has not competed yet); the final possible lead rankings are $[2,3,1]$, $[3, 2, 1]$, and $[3,1,2]$.\n\nWhat is the best final ranking that athlete $1$ can have at the end of the competition?","inputFormat":"- First line contains $t$ \u2014 the number of test cases.
