This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10^{12}$\n- $1 \\leq P_i \\leq i - 1$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"You are given a positive integer $K$ and a tree with $N$ vertices, rooted at vertex $1$.\n\nFor all integer $i$ ($2 \\leq i \\leq N$), $P_i$ is a parent of vertex $i$.\n\nLet's call an array $A$ consisting of $N$ positive integers **brilliant** if the following constraints are met\n- $A_{P_i}\\bmod A_i = 0$, for all integer $i$ ($2 \\leq i \\leq N$).\n- $\\prod_{i=1}^N A_i \\leq K$.\n\nCompute remainder modulo $998244353$ of the number of possible **brilliant** arrays.","inputFormat":"- The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$.\n- The second line contains $N-1$ integers $P_2, P_3, ..., P_{N}$.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"Print the number of **brilliant** arrays.
