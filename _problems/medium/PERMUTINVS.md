### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/mandarin/PERMUTINVS.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/bengali/PERMUTINVS.pdf), and [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK134/russian/PERMUTINVS.pdf) as well.

You are given two permutations $(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N)$ and $(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_N)$ of values from $1$ to $N$. Determine if there exists some permutation $(R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_N)$ of values from $1$ to $N$ such that the following conditions hold:

- The number of inversions of permutation $(P_{R_1}, P_{R_2}, \ldots, P_{R_N})$ is equal to $A$.
- The number of inversions of permutation $(Q_{R_1}, Q_{R_2}, \ldots, Q_{R_N})$ is equal to $B$.

If such permutations exist, find any of them.

As a reminder, the *number of inversions* of permutation $(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N)$ is defined as the number of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i \lt j \le N$ and $P_i \gt P_j$.
