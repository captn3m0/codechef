This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^6$\n\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"Chef JJ is a fan of random events and calculating probabilities.\n\nHe designed a machine called the binary string randomizer (BSRand). BSRand takes a binary string $A$ (say, of length $N$) as input and then generates a binary string $B$ (of the same length $N$) as output using the following algorithm:\n\nFor each $i$ from $1$ to $N$,\n- Uniformly randomly choose an integer $j$ between $1$ and $N$.\n- Uniformly randomly choose an integer $k$ between $1$ and $N$.\n- Set $B_i := A_j \\oplus A_k$ (where $\\oplus$ represents the bitwise XOR operation)\n\nGiven a binary string $A$, Chef JJ passes it through BSRand $T$ times (i.e, first he passes the binary string $A$ through the BSRand, then he passes the resultant binary string through BSRand again, and so on. This is done $T$ times in total). Calculate the probability that the final binary string obtained is $B$.\n\nYou need to print the probability of getting binary string $B$ modulo $998244353$. Formally, let $M = 998244353$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$. Output $p \\cdot q^{-1} \\pmod{M}$. In other words, output the (unique) integer $x$ which satisfies $0 \\le x \\lt M$ and $x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$.\n\n","inputFormat":"- The first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $T$ - the length of the binary strings $A$ and $B$ and the number of times chef JJ passes the binary string through BSRand, respectively.\n- The second line contains the binary string $A$.\n- The third line contains the binary string $B$.\n","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"Output the probability of getting binary string $B$ from binary string $A$ after passing it through BSRand $T$ times, modulo $998244353$.\n","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"2 1\n01\n11","output":"748683265\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false},{"id":"2","input":"2 1\n00\n11","output":"0\n","explanation":"","isDeleted":false},{"id":"3","input":"2 2\n11\n00","output":"1","explanation":"**Test Case $1$:** For $i = 1$, we notice that the BSRand can select the following combinations of $(j, k)$: $(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)$. Out of these $4$ combinations, we see that only $2$ of them give $1$ as result. Therefore, the probability that $B_1$ becomes $1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $i = 2$, similarly the the probability that $B_2$ becomes $1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore the probability that the final string is $\\texttt{11}$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 748683265 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n**Test Case $2$:** It can be proved that there is no way to get string $\\texttt{11}$ from $\\texttt{00}$.\n","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_wVUvk5MEmU","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"jeevanjyot","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>jeevanjyot<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"7-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/jeevanjyot'>jeevanjyot<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/matrix-exponentiation'>matrix-exponentiation<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/medium'>medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/probability'>probability<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/start19'>start19<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"Matrix Exponentiation","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/BINSTRRAND","time":{"view_start_date":1639243800,"submit_start_date":1639243800,"visible_start_date":1639243800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797923},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=BINSTRRAND","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
