We all know that Chef got a box of $N$ chocolates (numbered $1$ through $N$) as his birthday present. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th chocolate has a sweetness value $W_i$. Chef is going to play the following randomised game for fun with his brother:
- First, an integer $k$ between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive) is chosen uniformly randomly.
- Then, $k$ times, Chef chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently (each chocolate may be chosen multiple times). For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le k$), let's denote the sweetness of the $i$-th chocolate chosen by Chef by $A_i$.
- Chef's brother does the same thing â€• $k$ times, he also chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently from each other or Chef's choices (so each chocolate may still be chosen multiple times). For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le k$), let's denote the sweetness of the $i$-th chocolate chosen by Chef's brother by $B_i$.
- The score of the game is $\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^k \mathrm{gcd}(A_i, B_j)$.

Find the expected value of the score. It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are positive integers and $Q$ is coprime with $998,244,353$. You should compute $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $998,244,353$, where $Q^{-1}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse of $Q$ modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $W_1, W_2, \ldots, W_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $1 \le N \le 3 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le W_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$

### Example Input
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
2 2 2 2
```

### Example Output
```
887328320
15
```

### Explanation
**Example case 2:**
- When $k = 1$, the score is $1^2 \cdot 2 = 2$.
- When $k = 2$, the score is $2^2 \cdot 2 = 8$.
- When $k = 3$, the score is $3^2 \cdot 2 = 18$.
- When $k = 4$, the score is $4^2 \cdot 2 = 32$.

The expected score is $\frac{2+8+18+32}{4} = 15$.
