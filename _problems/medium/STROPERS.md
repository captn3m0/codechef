### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/hindi/STROPERS.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/bengali/STROPERS.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/mandarin/STROPERS.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/russian/STROPERS.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC20/vietnamese/STROPERS.pdf) as well.

Two strings $A$ and $B$ are *equivalent* (denoted by $A \sim B$) if they have the same lengths and $A$ can be transformed into $B$ by performing the following operation zero or more times: choose a substring of $A$ which contains '1' an even number of times and reverse this substring.

You are given a binary string $S$. Find the number of different equivalence classes of the substrings of this string. In other words, find the smallest possible size of a set $\mathcal{C}$ of binary strings with the following property: for each non-empty string $R$ which is a substring of $S$ (including $S$ itself), there is a string $X \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $R \sim X$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of equivalence classes among the substrings of the given string.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 1,000$
- $S$ contains only characters '0' and '1'

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $N \le 10$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** original constraints
