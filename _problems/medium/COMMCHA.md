There is a communication channel with $N+1$ stations (numbered $0$ through $N$). Station $0$ wants to send a message to station $N$. You may install memory disks at up to $K$ of the stations $1, 2, \ldots, N-1$. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by $(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)$, where $k \le K$ is the number of such stations, and let $v_0 = 0$ and $v_{k+1} = N$. In stations other than $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{k+1}$, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.

For each $i$ ($0 \le i \lt N$), if the message is currently at the station $i$, this station can send the message to the station $i + 1$. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability $p_i$, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station $i + 1$. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station $v_j$, where $j$ is the unique index such that $v_j \le i \lt v_{j+1}$ (if $i = v_j$, the message simply stays in the station $v_j$), and this station has to send it forward again.

Your task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station $N$ is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.

You are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_N$. For each valid $i$, $p_i = F_{i+1} / F_i$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N + 1$ space-separated integers $F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number â€” the smallest possible expected time needed for the message to reach station $N$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le \min(50, N-1)$
- $10^{12} \ge F_0 \ge F_1 \ge \ldots \ge F_N \ge 1$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Example Input
```
1
2 1
4 2 1
```

### Example Output
```
4.0000000000
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The probabilities of success are $p_0 = p_1 = 1/2$. If no memory disks are installed, the expected amount of time the message needs to reach station $2$ is $6$ seconds.

If a memory disk is installed at station $1$, the expected time is $4$ seconds ($2$ seconds to transfer from station $0$ to station $1$ and further $2$ seconds to transfer from station $1$ to station $2$).
