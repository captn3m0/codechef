Roger loves drawing polygons. For an arbitrary sequence of points in a 2D plane $P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{M-1}$, he can draw a polygon with $M$ sides by connecting the points $P_i$ and $P_{(i+1)\%M}$ with a straight line segment for each valid $i$. As a result, any point forms a polygon with $M = 1$, any two distinct points also form a polygon with $M = 2$ and a polygon may have sides with length $0$.

Roger calls a multiset $S$ of $M$ integers *polygonable* if there is a polygon created from a sequence with size $M$ (as defined above) such that the multiset of its side lengths is equal to $S$. For example, the multisets $(0, 0)$, $(1, 3, 3)$ or $(9, 9)$ are all polygonable, but $(4)$ and $(2, 5, 8)$ are not.

Roger has a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$), where each edge is coloured in one of $K$ colours (numbered $1$ through $N$). He wants to pick an unordered pair of distinct vertices in the tree and create a multiset $S = (S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_K)$, where $S_i$ is the number of edges on the path between the chosen vertices which have colour $i$. Now, Roger is wondering: in how many ways can he pick a pair of vertices such that the resulting multiset $S$ is polygonable? Find the number of such pairs.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains three space-separated integers $v$, $u$ and $c$, denoting an edge with colour $c$ between vertices $v$ and $u$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of valid pairs.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le K \le 10$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- $1 \le c \le K$
- the graph described on the input is a tree
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
