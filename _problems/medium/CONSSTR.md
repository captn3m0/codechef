### Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/mandarin/CONSSTR.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/russian/CONSSTR.pdf), and [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK132/bengali/CONSSTR.pdf) as well.

Consider a string $s$. The following operation can be performed on it successively several (possibly zero) times. 

- Select any non empty suffix of $s$ and append it to $s$

For example, if $s = \text{abcd}$, then $s$ can become either $\text{abcdd}$, $\text{abcdcd}$, $\text{abcdbcd}$ or $\text{abcdabcd}$ after one operation. Successive operations are now performed on the new string.

You are given a string $t$, the resultant string after applying several (possibly zero) operations on some string. You must find any such string $s$ of the **shortest** length from which $t$ can be obtained after some sequence of operations. It can be proven that such a string always exists.
