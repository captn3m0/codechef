{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"CLMARKS","problem_name":"Phineas and Marks","body":"Phineas goes to school after the lockdown is over and finds out that all his $N-1$ friends have turned into bullies. So he himself too starts disliking his friends. The teacher Dr Doof wants to distribute $M$ marks to his $N$ students (including Phineas).  Dr Doof is busy in his experiments and so wants the students to distribute $M$ marks among themselves such that each student gets a non negative integer marks or gets expelled. So he makes a plan.\r\n\r\n He makes all of his $N$ students stand in an line and then the $N^{\\text{th}}$ student is made the leader.  The task of the leader is to propose the distribution of $M$ marks among all the students present. Then a voting is carried out and all present students ( including the leader) can vote either for or against the distribution.\r\n- If the distribution is voted for by at least $50\\%$ of the students present, then it is is approved with the leader becoming the *deciding student* and the process ends.\r\n- Otherwise the last $K$ present students are expelled ( including the leader ). and the $(N-K)^{\\text{th}}$ student is appointed as the new leader and the process is repeated.\r\n\r\nIf there are $ \\leq K$ students left and the distribution is not approved, then all the present students will get expelled.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the characteristics of each of the $N$ students and everyone knows about it.\r\n- Everyone wants to maximize the marks they get or at least try not to get expelled (i.e. every student prefers getting $0$ marks over getting expelled).\r\n- Each of them have turned into bullies ( including Phineas ) and so given a choice of getting the \r\n    same marks and expel more students, then they would go for it.\r\n- If there are multiple distribution proposals maximizing the leader's marks that would be \r\n  accepted (voted for by atleast $50\\%$ of the students) then he  will propose the \r\n   lexicographically smallest such distribution.       \r\n    ( As an example: If $N = 6, M = 10$ and $(0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 5)$, $(0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 5)$ and $(2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5)$ \r\n      are the possible proposals that will be accepted, and 5 is the maximum marks \r\n      the leader can get, then he'll propose $(0 , 0, 4, 1, 0, 5)$)\r\n-  Each of them are brilliant logical thinkers.\r\n\r\nPhineas is confused and wants your help to know at what position he must stand so that he will be the *deciding student* if everyone thinks optimally and what maximum marks can he get being at that position.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \r\n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers $N, M, K$, which are the total \r\n   number of students $N$, the total marks $M$, and the number of students expelled in each round of failed voting $K$.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\nFor each testcase, output in a single line two space separated integers $-$ the position that Phineas should stand at to be the *deciding student* and the maximum marks he can get standing at that position. \r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100000$\r\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$\r\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10^9$\r\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq N$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n\t2\r\n\t4 1 2\r\n    5 1 1\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n\t4 1\r\n    4 0\r\n\t\r\n###Explanation:\r\n1. For the first test case the $4^{\\text{th}}$ student will be the leader initially and he needs at least 2 votes to approve his distribution. As $K=2$, the $3^{\\text{rd}}$ student will be expelled if the distribution is not approved and so he votes in favour of it. The $4^{\\text{th}}$ student will himself vote for it and so he will be the *deciding student* anyway. So he gives himself all the marks at stake , i.e, 1 mark.\r\n\r\n2. For the second test case the $5^{\\text{th}}$ student will be expelled because he will not be able to gather at least 3 votes for any proposal.
