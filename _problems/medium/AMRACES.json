The city contained several junctions. Some pairs of junctions are directly connected by a bidirectional road which does not pass through any intermediate junction. In Drias there was a unique simple path to get from any junction to any other. Note that in a simple path, junctions should not be repeated. Also, there is at most one bidirectional road between a pair of junctions. The races were being held annually. Two junctions are said to be <i>farthest apart<\/i> if the number of roads in the unique simple path between them is maximum possible. Each year the organizers chose a pair of distinct junctions as the start and the finish of the race such that they are a <i>farthest apart<\/i> pair of junctions. No unordered pair of junctions was chosen more than once. After <b>k<\/b> years the organizers ran out of pairs of <i>farthest apart<\/i> junctions, and decided to move the races to a different city.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>These competitions described above occurred a long time ago, it is now impossible to reconstruct the road network which existed at that time. But now you are given the responsibility of building a new city which would meet those properties. And you want to have the minimum number of junctions so as to reduce cost. So, your job is build a road network with the least number of junctions so that if the race were to be held on this road network, it would last for exactly <b>k<\/b> years. Note that from the earlier description it is clear that every year the race must occur between an unique unordered pair of junctions.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The first line contains the number of test cases <b>T<\/b><\/li>\n\t<li>Each of the next <b>T<\/b> lines contains a single integer <b>k<\/b> for the respective test case<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Print answers for the test cases one by one.
