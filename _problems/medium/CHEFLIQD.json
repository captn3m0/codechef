One fine morning, his father asked him to go to market and buy liquid ingredients in order to make beverages for that particular day. Hari liked the idea as he really wanted to visit the shop of ingredients. His father gave him <b>M<\/b> Rupees to buy the ingredients. In addition to money, his father gave him <b>K<\/b> containers too. The containers are of volume <b>C<sub>1<\/sub>, C<sub>2<\/sub>, ........., C<sub>K<\/sub><\/b> and can hold the liquid of same volume.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt the shop, there are <b>N<\/b> types of liquid ingredients. The ingredients have price <b>P<sub>1<\/sub>, P<sub>2<\/sub>, ........, P<sub>N<\/sub><\/b> Rupees and are of volume <b>V<sub>1<\/sub>, V<sub>2<\/sub>, ........, V<sub>N<\/sub><\/b>. Now, Hari has to buy some ingredients with the amount(<b>M<\/b>) that he has, but he has few conditions also. The conditions are as following:\n<\/p>\n<p><ul>\n<li>Hari doesn't want the ingredients to mix, so each container may contain at most <b>1<\/b> item.<\/li>\n<li>If Hari buys an ingredient, he wants its complete volume. So, Hari will buy an ingredient only if he can buy the complete volume of that ingredient.<\/li>\n<li>Hari doesn't want to waste more than one container for a single ingredient. So he'll buy an ingredient only if he has an empty container that can contain the complete volume of that ingredient.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<p>Now, Hari wants to buy as much volume of ingredients as possible. Help him in maximizing the total volume that he can buy satisfying all of the above conditions.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of the input contains <b>T<\/b>, the number of text cases.
