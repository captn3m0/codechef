It is also guaranteed that for each valid $i$, $A_i+A_1 \\ge A_{i+1}$.\r\n\r\nAlice and Bob want to play $Q$ independent games using this sequence. Before they play these games, Alice should choose a positive integer $G$ between $1$ and $M$ (inclusive). The rules of each game are as follows:\r\n- There is a set $S$ of positive integers representing allowed moves in this game. For each valid $i$, in the $i$-th game, this set is $S = \\{A_{L_i},A_{L_i+1},\\ldots,A_{R_i}\\}$ (in other words, given by a contiguous subsequence of $A$).\r\n- The game is played with a single pile. Let's denote the number of objects in this pile by $P$. At the beginning of the game, $P = G$. In other words, Alice and Bob play all the games with the same initial number of objects that Alice chooses.\r\n- The players alternate turns; Alice plays first.\r\n- In each turn, the current player must choose a positive integer $b$ from the set $S$ such that $b \\le P$ and remove $b$ objects from the pile, i.e. change $P$ to $P-b$.\r\n- When the current player cannot choose any such integer $b$, this player loses this game.\r\n\r\nBoth players play optimally. You need to find the maximum number of games Alice can win if she chooses $G$ optimally.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $Q$ and $M$.\r\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\r\n- $Q$ lines follow.
