To pay for it, he is going to take one or more loans. \r\n\r\nThere are $n$ banks in the city. The $i$-th bank offers loans up to $s_i$ rupees with a daily compound interest rate of $p_i$. He gets all the loans on Day 0.\r\n\r\nThereafter, on each day, Alexey can afford to spend at most $t$ rupees on repaying the loans (and the interest!). He wants to finish repaying all the loans completely within the next $m$ days (or faster). What is maximum amount that he can take out on loan on Day 0?\r\n\r\nSo, the full process is as follows:\r\n\r\n* Alexey takes any non-negative real amount of rupees $0 \\le x_i \\le s_i$ from each bank. Sum $x_1 + \\dots + x_n$ is what we want to maximize.\r\n* On each of the next $m$ days, as long as there are loans remaining, the following happens: The remaining amount in the i-th loan, if it is yet to be completely paid off, gets multiplied by $(1 + \\frac{p_i}{1000000})$.
