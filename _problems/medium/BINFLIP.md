### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/mandarin/BINFLIP.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/russian/BINFLIP.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/SNCK1A21/vietnamese/BINFLIP.pdf) as well.

Chef has a binary string $S$ of length $N$, where the first $K$ characters of $S$ are '$\texttt{1}$', while the rest are '$\texttt{0}$'. He wants to make all the characters equal to '$\texttt{0}$'. You are allowed to perform the following operation on the string $S$ as long as $2^{i-1} \leq N$:
- In the $i^{th}$ operation, you can select any contiguous range of $2^{i-1}$ indices of $S$ and flip their values.

He can use the above operation any number of times. If there is no sequence of operations that can convert the string to all '$\texttt{0}$'s, print $\texttt{NO}$. 

Otherwise, print $\texttt{YES}$ in the first line and then describe the operations. Print the starting indices of the contiguous range to be flipped in each operation. See Output Format for further details.
