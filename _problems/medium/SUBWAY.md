Being a newcomer to Computopia, Chef is confused by the countless subway lines in the city. Help him!

You are given an undirected graph with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges. There are no self-loops and no simple cycles that contain more than 2 edges in the graph (i.e. if we replaced each set of multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices by one edge, we would obtain a tree). Each edge also has a colour.

Consider a simple path with length $K$ in the graph that passes through edges with colours $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_K$ in this order. The *cost* of this path is defined as $(A_1 \neq A_2) + (A_2 \neq A_3) + \dots + (A_{K-1} \neq A_K)$, where the boolean value `true` is interpreted as the integer $1$ and `false` is interpreted as $0$. In other words, the cost of a simple path is the number of pairs of neighbouring (consecutive) edges on this path with different colours. The cost of a path with length $0$ is defined to be $0$.

You need to answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given vertices $u$ and $v$; you should find the maximum possible cost of some simple path connecting them.

Note that a simple path may not visit a vertex more than once.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- Each of the next $M$ lines contains three space-separated integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ denoting an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ with colour $w$.
- The next line contains an integer $Q$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum cost of a simple path.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N, Q \le 500,000$
- $1 \le M \le 1,000,000$
- $1 \le u, v \le N$
- for each edge, $u \neq v$
- $1 \le w \le M$
