Chef has an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and Chefina has an integer sequence $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_M$. Since Chef is a genius, he always keeps himself busy with some tasks. One day, Chef took the sequences $A$ and $B$ and constructed a matrix $C$ with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$) such that for each valid $i$ and $j$, the value in row $i$ and column $j$ is $C_{i,j} = A_i \oplus B_j$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.

Chefina is curious about this matrix, but she does not have a lot of time, so she asked Chef to tell her some information about it. For each integer $L$ from $1$ to $\mathrm{max}(N, M)$ inclusive:
- For all integers $X$ and $Y$ such that $1 \le X, Y \le L$, consider all submatrices of $C$ with $X$ rows and $Y$ columns.
- The beauty of a submatrix is defined as its size (the number of elements in it) multiplied by the XOR of all elements in the submatrix.
- Chef should find the sum of beauties of all these submatrices modulo $1,000,000,007$.

**Note:** The definition of the submatrix is used according to [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Submatrix.html).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- The third line contains $M$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_M$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing $\mathrm{max}(N, M)$ space-separated integers â€• the sums of beauties for $L = 1, 2, \ldots, \mathrm{max}(N, M)$, modulo $1,000,000,007$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N, M \le 65,000$
- $0 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- $0 \le B_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $65,000$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $65,000$

### Example Input
```
1
3 4
1 2 3
4 3 2 1
```

### Example Output
```
30 128 386 482
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The matrix $C$ is
```
5 2 3 0
6 1 0 3
7 0 1 2
```

For $L=1$, the sum of beauties is $(5+2+3+0+6+1+0+3+7+0+1+2) \cdot 1=30$. For $L=2$, the sum of beauties is $(5+2+3+0+6+1+0+3+7+0+1+2) \cdot 1 + (7+1+3+7+1+3+7+1+3) \cdot 2 + (3+1+3+1+3+1+3+1) \cdot 2 + (0+0+0+0+0+0) \cdot 4 = 128$.
