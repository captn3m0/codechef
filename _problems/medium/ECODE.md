###  All submissions for this problem are available. 

Professor X got lost in a maze of an ancient tomb in Egypt. While he was finding the way to escape, he got a message of the tomb builders on the old walls:

- The code to open the exit door is the sequence C of n digits formed c1..cn (ci∈\[0,9\] ).
- For every sequence C, combining with the given integers A,B, call:
    
    - h0=0
    - hi=(hi-1×A+ci) mod B
- The smallest sequence C (in lexicological order) satisfying hn=G (where G is a given integer) is the exit code which professor X needs. 
    - 1≤n≤12
    - 10≤A,B≤1015
    - 0≤G&lt;B
    - The input satisfies that the answer always exist.
### Request

Give the integers n,A,B,G, help professor X find out the exit code! ### Input

One and only line contains the integers n,A,B,G, respectively, each of them is separated with at least one space character.

### Output

Output in a single line the exit code found.

### Example

**Input:**
<pre>3 11 111 92
</pre>
**Output:**```
084
<pre>
### Limitations

* 1&lt;=n&lt;=12

* 10&lt;=A,B&lt;=1015

* 0&lt;=G&lt;B

* The input satisfies that the answer always exist.
