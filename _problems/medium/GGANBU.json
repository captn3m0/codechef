This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq M \\leq N-1$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 30$\n- $1 \\leq P_i \\leq N$\n- $-10^9 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq u, v \\leq N$\n- $S$ will always contain only edges which are a part of the tree.\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n- Sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"*\u201cDo you know what someone with no money has in common with someone with too much money?
