Gritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are $N$ countries numbered $1$ through $N$ in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation $P$ of all $N$ countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm:
- for each $v$ from $1$ to $N$ inclusive:
    - travel to country $v$
    - travel from country $v$ to country $P_v$, then from country $P_v$ to country $P_{P_v}$, and so on until he reaches country $v$ again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a *cyclic route*

(Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if $v=P_v$, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country $v$.)

Unfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence $A_{1..N}$ with the following meaning: for each country $v$, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is $A_v$. Given the sequence $A$, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations $P$ consistent with this sequence, modulo $998244353$ (it's prime).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of possible permutations modulo $998244353$ (it's prime).

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^6$
- $1 \le A_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (40 points):** $1 \le N \le 5000$

**Subtask #2 (60 points):** original constraints
