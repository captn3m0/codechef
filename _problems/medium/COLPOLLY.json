{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"COLPOLLY","problem_name":"What is this, a crossover episode","body":"You are given a simple polygon (that is, its edges don't intersect with each other, apart from touching at the vertices) with $n$ vertices. The vertices are numbered, in clockwise order, as $1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Additionally, there are $m$ non-intersecting chords within the polygon. Note however that chords can touch each other at a vertex of the polygon. A chord is defined to be a line segment connecting two vertices of the polygon and which remains completely inside the polygon.\r\n\r\nConsidering it as a graph, there will be $n$ edges of the polygon, and $m$ extra chords, i.e. $n+m$ edges overall. Find a minimum coloring of the vertices, such that no two adjacent vertices have same color.\r\n\r\n###Input:\r\n\r\n- The first line will contain two space separated integers, $n$ and $m$, denoting the number of vertices and the number of chords respectively.\r\n- The next $m$ lines contain $2$ space separated integers, $x$ and $y$, denoting a chord between vertices $x$ and $y$. \r\n\r\nIt is guaranteed that there exists a simple polygon where all chords lie within the polygon and no $2$ chords intersect.\r\n\r\n###Output:\r\n- In the first line, print $k$, the number of colors you will be using to color the polygon's vertices.\r\n- Then in a new line, print $n$ space separated integers, $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$, where $c_i$ is the color of the $i^{th}$ vertex. You should ensure that $1 \\leq c_i \\leq k$.\r\n- You should use the minimum possible number of colors. If there are multiple solutions, print any one.\r\n\r\n###Constraints \r\n- $3 \\leq n \\leq 10000$\r\n- $0 \\leq m \\leq n - 3$\r\n- $1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$\r\n\r\n###Sample Input:\r\n\t4 1\r\n\t1 3\r\n\r\n###Sample Output:\r\n\t3\r\n\t1 2 3 2\r\n\t\r\n###Explanation:\r\nAll adjacent node pairs are: [1, 2] [2, 3] [3, 4] [4, 1] [1, 3].
