Rohit dreams he is in a shop with an infinite amount of marbles. He is allowed to select n marbles. There are marbles of k different colors. From each color there are also infinitely many marbles. Rohit wants to have at least one marble of each color, but still there are a lot of possibilities for his selection. In his effort to make a decision he wakes up.<br />
Now he asks you how many possibilities for his selection he would have had.<br />
Assume that marbles of equal color can't be distinguished, and the order of the marbles is irrelevant.
</p>
<p><h3>Input</h3>
</p><p></p><p align=justify><br />
The first line of input contains a number T &lt;= 100 that indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of one line containing n and k, where n is the number of marbles Rohit selects and k is the number of different colors of the marbles. You can assume that 1&lt;=k&lt;=n&lt;=1000000.
