All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK47/mandarin2/IDOLS2.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK47/russian/IDOLS1.pdf) as well.

Mike is a cool kid, so he's the most popular person in his school. All the girls want to be with him while all the boys want to be like him.

There are **N** persons in Mike's school. No person in the school has a name(except Mike), but all of them have a unique ID integer number for the range\[1..**N**\]. Mike's ID equals to 1. Also, each person(except Mike) has his/her *personal idol*, who is another person from the school. Finally, each person **X** has an integer number **AX**.

Let's define functions **F** and **G** for a person with ID equals to **X**:

- If **X** = 1(which means that person **X** is Mike), then **FX** = **AX** and **GX** = 1;
- Otherwise, let **Y** be the personal idol for **X**. 
    - If **FY** + 1 &lt; **AX**, then **FX** = **AX** and **GX** = 1;
    - If **FY** + 1 &gt; **AX**, then **FX** = **FY** + 1 and **GX** = **GY**;
    - If **FY** + 1 = **AX**, then **FX** = **FY** + 1 and **GX** = **GY** + 1.

It's guaranteed, that it's possible to calculate functions **F** and **G** for every person in the school.

You are to write a program, that can efficiently process queries of the following types:

- 0 **X** **NEW\_VALUE** - change the value of **AX** to **NEW\_VALUE**;
- 1 **X** - calculate **FX** and **GX**.

### Input

The first line of the input contains two integers **N** and **Q**, denoting the number of the persons in Mike's school and the number of queries to process.

The second line contains **N** integers **Ai**, denoting **A1**, **A2**, ..., **AN**.

The third line contains **N - 1** integers **Pi**, denoting the personal idols of persons with IDs equal to 2, 3, ..., **N**. 1 ≤ **Pi** &lt; **i**.

The next **Q** lines contain information about the queries. The format of the queries is the same with the one described in the statement.

### Output

For each query of the second type, output a single line containing two integers, **FX** and **GX**.

### Constraints

1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100000;

1 ≤ **Q** ≤ 300000;

1 ≤ **Ai** ≤ 109, for each person;

1 ≤ **X** ≤ **N**, 1 ≤ **NEW\_VALUE** ≤ 109, for each query of the first type.

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 5
0 1 100

<b>Output:</b>
5 5
</pre>
### Explanations

In the input, before the second query, **F**'s and **G's** equals to the following:

**ID****F****G**111222333444555After the second query, **F**'s and **G's** equals to the following:

**ID****F****G**1100121011310214103151041
