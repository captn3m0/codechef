This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1\\le n\\le 50\\,000$ \n- $1\\le m\\le 10$\n- $1\\le d\\le 1000$\n- $0.4\\le p\\le 0.6$\n- The number $p$ is given with exactly $4$ digits after the decimal point.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/mandarin\/BAKERY.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/russian\/BAKERY.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKFL21\/vietnamese\/BAKERY.pdf) as well.\n\nYou are the owner of a bakery and you have $m$ employees who serve the customers.\n\nWhen a customer enters the bakery, he waits in line behind other customers who are waiting (or he is the first of the line if there are no other customers waiting).\n\nWhenever there is an employee who is not serving anybody and there is at least one customer waiting in line, one employee immediately starts serving the first person in the line (who, therefore, leaves the line). Serving a customer requires exactly $d$ seconds.\n\nThe waiting time of a customer is the number of seconds elapsed between his entrance in the bakery and the moment someone starts serving him.\n\nYou have just opened the bakery today, and you know that, for each $i=0,1,\\dots,n-1$, with probability $p$ a customer will enter the bakery exactly $i$ seconds after the opening (these $n$ events are independent and the probability $p$ is the same for all of them).\n\nWhat is the expected value of the total waiting time of all the customers (that is, the sum of the waiting times of all the customers)?","inputFormat":"- The only line of the input contains the three integers $n$, $m$, $d$ and the real number $p$ \u2013 the number of seconds at which a customer may enter, the number of employees, the amount of seconds necessary to serve a customer, the probability that a customer enters at any given second.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"Print a single real number, the expected value of the total waiting time of all the customers.
