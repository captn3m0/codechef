Chef does not have a number.\n\nThe chase starts at time $t = 0$ and takes place on a circular road with length $L$. Positions on the road are described by one real-valued coordinate; for each real number $x$, position $x+L$ is the same as position $x$.

The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $L$ and $V_c$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_N$.\n- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_N$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \u2014 the time when Chef gets caught.
