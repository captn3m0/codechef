Consider a sequence with an even length $2L$. A *left rotation* consists of moving the first element of the sequence to the end. The sequence is *good* if it is possible to perform some number of left rotations (possibly zero) and divide the resulting sequence into two halves (containing the first $L$ and last $L$ elements respectively) such that the smallest value in one half is greater then the largest value in the other half.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Find the number of its non-empty contiguous subsequences with even length which is good.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of good contiguous subsequences.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^3$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ are pair-wise distinct
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Example Input
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
4 2 1 3
4
1 3 2 4
```

### Example Output
```
4
4
3
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The good subsequences are $[1, 2]$, $[2, 3]$, $[3, 4]$ and $[1, 2, 3, 4]$.

**Example case 3:** The good subsequences are $[1, 3]$, $[3, 2]$ and $[2, 4]$.
