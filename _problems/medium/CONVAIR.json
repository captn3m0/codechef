Currently, there are $N$ airports (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ bidirectional flights in Chefland. Each flight connects two distinct airports, but there may be any number of flights between each pair of airports. We say that a system of flights is connected if it is possible to travel from each airport to all other airports using these flights. For each airport $i$, we also define its degree $d_i$ as the number of flights that have $i$ as one of their endpoints.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it turns out that the current flight system is not necessarily connected. This is unacceptable, so the mayor asked you to propose a new flight system. Formally, this means that you can remove some of the existing flights (possibly none) and arbitrarily create some new flights (possibly none). You may even create multiple flights between the same pairs of airports.\r\n\r\nHowever, the infrastructure and number of employees at each airport is optimised for its current degree $d_i$, so it would be inconvenient if the new degrees of airports differ too much from the old ones. For each airport $i$, let's define $x_i$ as the degree of airport $i$ in the new proposed system of flights. We define the *inconvenience* of this system as $\\sum_{i=1}^N |d_i-x_i|$.\r\n\r\nYou should propose a connected system of flights such that its inconvenience is the smallest possible. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
