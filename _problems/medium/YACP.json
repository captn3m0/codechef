This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 20$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq N$\n- The elements of $A$ are distinct.\n- Each input file contains at most $3$ tests with $N \\gt 10$.\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (15 points):**\n- $N \\le 14$\n\n**Subtask 2 (15 points):**\n- $N \\le 16$\n\n**Subtask 3 (40 points):**\n- $N \\le 18$\n\n**Subtask 4 (30 points):**\n- $N \\le 20$\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Nayra doesn't like stories of people receiving random arrays as birthday presents, but this time she received an array as a present for her own birthday! After struggling for a day trying to figure out what to do with this array, she asked Aryan for help. He gave her this problem.\n\n\nYou are given an array $A = [A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N]$ containing $N$ **distinct** integers. Count the number of ways to form (unordered) sets of disjoint increasing [subsequences](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Subsequence) of $A$.\n\nFormally, count the number of sets $S = \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k\\}$ such that:\n- Each $S_i$ is an increasing subsequence of $A$.\n- If $i \\neq j$, $S_i$ and $S_j$ are disjoint, i.e, $i\\neq j \\implies S_i \\cap S_j = \\emptyset$\n\nNote that it is *not necessary* that the sequences $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k$ form a partition of $A$ - in other words, some elements of $A$ may not be in any chosen subsequence.\n\nTwo sets are considered equal if they contain the same subsequences. For example, the sets $\\{[1, 2], [3]\\}$ and $\\{[3], [1, 2]\\}$ are considered to be the same and should only be counted once.\n\nNote that the final answer can be rather large, so compute its remainder after dividing it by $10^9 + 7$.\n\nPlease refer to the sample for a few examples.","inputFormat":"- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ - the size of $A$.\n- The second line contains $N$ *distinct* space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N$ - the elements of $A$.\n","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"For each test, print one line containing a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"2\n2\n1 2\n7\n1 2 7 3 6 4 5","output":"5\n1537\n","explanation":"**Test case 1:** All possible sets are $\\{ \\}, \\{[1]\\}, \\{[2]\\}, \\{[1], [2]\\}, \\{[1, 2]\\}$. Note that the empty set is also counted; and it is not necessary to use every element of $A$ in some increasing subsequence.\n\n**Test case 2:** Some of the valid possible ways are:\n- $S = \\{[1,2,7], [3,6], [4]\\}$.\n- $S = \\{[1,2,6], [7], [3], [4]\\}$\n- $S = \\{[1,2,6], [7], [3, 5], [4]\\}$\n- $S = \\{[1,2,6], [7], [3, 4]\\}$\n- $S = \\{[1,4], [2,3], [6], [7]\\}$\n\nOnce again, note that we count *unordered* sets.
