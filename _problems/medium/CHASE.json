This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $2 \\le N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\le U_i, V_i \\le N$\n- The chambers and passageways form a tree.\n- $1 \\le A_j, B_j \\le N$\n- $1 \\le K_j \\le 10^9$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask 1** (10 points): Each chamber is connected by at most two passageways.\n- **Subtask 2** (20 points): $K = 1$ for all queries.\n- **Subtask 3** (30 points): $2 \\le N \\le 5000$, $1 \\le Q \\le 5000$\n- **Subtask 4** (40 points): Original constraints.","subtasksState":true,"statement":"Chef is collecting special ingredients in a cave. The cave has $N$ chambers and $N-1$ passageways forming a tree. In other words, it is possible to move from one chamber to any other chamber using the passageways. Each passageway is of equal length and can be traversed in both directions.\n\nAt $0$-th second, Chef is at chamber $A_j$. At the start of each second, he can choose to either stay in the current chamber or move along a passageway to another chamber in $1$ second. To collect more ingredients, he wants to visit as many distinct chambers as possible before leaving the cave at chamber $B_j$.\n\nThere is a ghost that copies Chef's movement with a delay of $K_j$ seconds. This means that:\n\n- Before $K_j$-th second, the ghost is not in the cave yet.\n- At $K_j$-th second, the ghost appears in chamber $A_j$.\n- At $t$-th second ($t \\ge K_j$), the ghost will be in the same place that Chef was at $(t - K_j)$-th second.\n\nThe ghost will capture the Chef if, at some moment of time, both of them are in the same chamber or using the same passageway, including the moment when Chef is about to leave at chamber $B_j$.\n\nFor a given start chamber $A_j$, end chamber $B_j$ and ghost movement delay $K_j$, help Chef determine the maximum number of distinct chambers he can visit.
