All submissions for this problem are available.The Chef wants to color a **3xN** grid and he has **N** different types of colors to do that. Each cell of the grid has to be colored with exactly one color. A coloring of the grid is
considered *beautiful* if no two cells of the same row or same column have the same color.

The cells of first two rows are already colored and they don’t violate the *beautiful* condition (one color doesn’t appear more than once on the same row or on the same column).

Find how many different ways he can color the **3rd** row such that the resulting grid is *beautiful*. Two ways of coloring are considered different if there is at least one cell which is colored with different color.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases.

- The first line of each test
    case contains an integer **N**.
- The next line contains **N** integers **A1, A2, ..., AN**, where **Ai**(**1** ≤ **i** ≤ **N**) is the color of the cell at column **i** of **1st** row.
- The next line contains **N** integers **B1, B2, ..., BN**, where **Bi**(**1** ≤ **i** ≤ **N**) is the color of the cell at column **i** of **2nd** row.

### Output

For each test case, output the number of ways to color the **3rd** row such that the resulting grid is *beautiful*. Output the result modulo **1000000007**.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **20**
- **3** ≤ **N** ≤ **1000**
- **A1, A2, ..., AN** is a permutation of the numbers **1, 2, ..., N**.
- **B1, B2, ..., BN** is a permutation of the numbers **1, 2, ..., N**.
- **Ai** ≠ **Bi** ( **1** ≤ **i** ≤ **N**)

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
2
4
2 1 4 3
4 2 3 1
4
2 4 1 3
1 3 2 4

<b>Output:</b>
2
4
</pre>
### Explanation

For the 1st case the valid ways to color the **3rd** row are: {1,3,2,4} and {3,4,1,2}.
For the 2nd case the valid ways are: {3,1,4,2} , {3,2,4,1} , {4,1,3,2} and {4,2,3,1}.
