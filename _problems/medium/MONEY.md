The Government of Byteland has decide to issue new currency notes with special protection features to commemorate a great mathematician. 

 It has decided to issue notes summing up to N such that all the sums from 1 to N should be possible to be made by selecting some of the notes. Also this has to be done in way such that if any note from 1 to N can be made in more than one way by combining other selected notes then that set of notes is not valid.

 For example, with N = 7,

 The valid sets are:
 {1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
 {1,1,1,4}
 {1,2,2,2}
 {1,2,4}

 Invalid sets are:
 {1,1,1,2,2} beacuse the sum adds up to 7 but 2 can be made by {1,1} and {2}, 3 can be made by {1,1,1} and {1,2}, 4 can be made by {1,1,2} and {2,2} and similarly 5, 6 and 7 can also be made in multiple ways using the same set.
 {1,1,3,6} beacuse all from 1 to 7 can be uniquely made but the sum is not 7 (its 11).

 Before implementing this idea of issuing these new set of notes, the Government wants to know how many possible valid sets are there for a given N. Your program should help the Government to find this out.

### Input

First line will contain the number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=6666). 
 Each test case will have one line containing an integer N (&lt;= 2^31-1).

### Output

For each value of N output the total number of valid sets on a separate line.
