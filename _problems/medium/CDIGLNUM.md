Chef and Abhishek are two friends. Abhishek really appreciates Chef's skills and wants to learn the secret formula behind Chef's tasty dishes. Chef will tell his secret formula only to a 
competent person. So to check Abhishek's competency, Chef asked him to solve the following problem.  
  

Find the number of integers between $0$ and $N$ (inclusive) such that the product of digits of the integer is greater than or equal to $K!$, where $K$ is the number of digits present in the integer.  
  
**Example**: Consider $N = 1000$. 
- The only digit present in the integer $0$ is $0$. So the product of digit is also $0$ and $1! = 1$. So $0$ will be not counted in the answer because $0 \ngtr 1$.
- The digits present in the integer $25$ are $2, 5$. So the product of digits is $(2 \cdot 5) = 10$ and $2 ! = 2$. So $25$ will be counted in the answer because  $10 \geq 2$. 
- The digits present in the integer $11$ are $1, 1$. So the product of digits is $(1 \cdot 1) = 1$ and $2 ! = 2$. So $11$ will be not counted in the answer because $1 \ngtr 2$.
- The digits present in the integer $157$ are $1, 5, 7$. So the product of digits is $(1 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) = 35$ and  $3! = 6$. So $157$ will be counted in the answer because $35 \geq 6$. 


Since Abhishek is a lazy person, he wants your help to solve the problem.  


  
**Note**: $K!$ represents the factorial of $K$ and $K! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (K-1) \cdot K$ .
