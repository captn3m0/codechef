Abhishek really appreciates Chef's skills and wants to learn the secret formula behind Chef's tasty dishes. Chef will tell his secret formula only to a \ncompetent person. So to check Abhishek's competency, Chef asked him to solve the following problem.  \n  \n\nFind the number of integers between $0$ and $N$ (inclusive) such that the product of digits of the integer is greater than or equal to $K!$, where $K$ is the number of digits present in the integer.  \n  \n**Example**: Consider $N = 1000$. \n- The only digit present in the integer $0$ is $0$. So the product of digit is also $0$ and $1! = 1$. So $0$ will be not counted in the answer because $0 \\ngtr 1$.\n- The digits present in the integer $25$ are $2, 5$. So the product of digits is $(2 \\cdot 5) = 10$ and $2 ! = 2$. So $25$ will be counted in the answer because  $10 \\geq 2$. \n- The digits present in the integer $11$ are $1, 1$. So the product of digits is $(1 \\cdot 1) = 1$ and $2 ! = 2$. So $11$ will be not counted in the answer because $1 \\ngtr 2$.\n- The digits present in the integer $157$ are $1, 5, 7$. So the product of digits is $(1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7) = 35$ and  $3! = 6$. So $157$ will be counted in the answer because $35 \\geq 6$. \n\n\nSince Abhishek is a lazy person, he wants your help to solve the problem.  \n\n\n  \n**Note**: $K!$ represents the factorial of $K$ and $K! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (K-1) \\cdot K$ .  \n  \n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10145$\n- $0 \\leq N \\leq 10^{100}$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask #1 (10 points):**     \n - $1 \\leq T \\leq 200$   \n - $0 \\leq N \\leq 44000000$  \n\n**Subtask #2 (90 points):** Original constraints \n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/AUG21\/bengali\/CDIGLNUM.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/AUG21\/mandarin\/CDIGLNUM.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/AUG21\/russian\/CDIGLNUM.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/AUG21\/vietnamese\/CDIGLNUM.pdf) as well.\n\nChef and Abhishek are two friends.
