The hall in which the exam will be held contains $N$ seats (numbered $1$ through $N$) arranged in a row. Initially, each seat is either empty or occupied by a participant in the exam.

To do this, Chef may perform a number of operations (possibly zero). In each operation, he can ask a participant to move from his seat to an adjacent seat, either to its left or right, if such a seat exists and is empty.\r\n\r\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make sure that no two participants are sitting next to each other (in adjacent seats), or determine that it is impossible.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
