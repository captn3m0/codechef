Vivek is quite fond of expected values. One day, he stumbled upon the following problem. He cannot solve it, so he is asking you for help.

Consider all trees with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$); two trees are different if there is a pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ such that there is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ in exactly one of these trees.

For a uniformly randomly chosen tree $T$, let's denote the degrees of vertices $1$ through $N$ in this tree by $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_N$. Then, let's denote $A = (d_1 \cdot d_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot d_N)^K$. Find the expected value of $A$.

It can be proved that the expected value of $A$ can be expressed as a fraction $P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime positive integers and $Q$ is coprime to $998,244,353$. You should compute the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $998,244,353$, where $Q^{-1}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse of $Q$ modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353}$.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 2,000,000$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2,000,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points):**
- $T = 10$
- $2 \le N \le 7$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100,000$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** $K = 1$

### Example Input
```
2
3 1
4 2
```

### Example Output
```
2
748683279
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** There are $3$ labelled trees with size $3$: the paths $[1-2-3]$, $[1-3-2]$ and $[3-1-2]$.

The expected value is $\left((1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)^1 + (1 \cdot 1 \cdot 2)^1 + (2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1)^1\right) / 3 = 2$, so $P = 2$, $Q = 1$, $Q^{-1} = 1$ and the answer is $2$.
