Chef lives in a country called ChefLand. The country can be represented as a tree of $N$ cities (numbered $1$ through $N$) connected by $N-1$ roads. For each valid $i$, the cost of a house in city $i$ is $A_i$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given cities $u$ and $v$ (possibly identical); Chef is planning to buy houses in these cities. Chef's *happiness quotient* is equal to the product of the costs of houses in all cities which lie on the simple path between $u$ and $v$ (both inclusive). Since Chef loves playing with factors, he is asking you to tell him the number of factors of his happiness quotient, modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9+7$).

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ denoting that cities $x$ and $y$ are connected by a road.
- The following line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- The following line contains a single integer $Q$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of factors of the happiness quotient modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9+7$).

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 3$
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $N, Q \le 10^3$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $N \le 10^3$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints
