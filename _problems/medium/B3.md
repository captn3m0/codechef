<p>In the game of "BattleShip V", you control a cannon which is attacking a large enemy battleship, armed with many guns. Your goal is to destroy as many of the guns as possible.</p>
<p>The battle field is a 2D Cartesian grid, where your cannon is located at the origin.</p>
<p>The enemy battleship is a horizontal line segment located from the coordinates (X1 , Y) to (X2, Y).<br />
There are exactly (X2 - X1 + 1) guns on the ship, located at the integer points (X1, Y), (X1+1, Y), ..., (X2, Y).
</p>
<p>
However, the problem is, you cannot always fire at a gun. There are supernatural rocks located at all points of the battlefield whose X and Y coordinates are both integers. In order to fire successfully at an enemy's gun, the line connecting your cannon and that gun must not<br />
go through any rocks.
</p>
<p>
How many guns you successfully destroy?
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow.
</p>
<p>
Each test case consists of one line containing three numbers Y, and X1, X2 (2100000000 > &#8804; Y &#8804; 2100000000, -2100000000 &#8804; X <sub>1</sub> &#8804; X<sub>2</sub> &#8804; 2100000000).
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case, output the number of the enemy battleship's guns that your cannon can destroy.
