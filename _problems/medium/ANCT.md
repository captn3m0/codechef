### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/mandarin/ANCT.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/bengali/ANCT.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/russian/ANCT.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME98/vietnamese/ANCT.pdf) as well.

There is a game played on a one-dimensional axis. $N$ stones will appear on this axis. Each of these stones is described by three numbers $x_i$, $t_i$, $c_i$, meaning the stone will appear at a point $x_i$, at time $t_i$, and has a value $c_i$.

There are $p$ players initially (at time $0$) all at the point $0$. If a player is at a point $x$ at time $t$, then at time $t + 1$, he/she can be either at $x$ or at $x+1$. A player is able to pick up a stone with value $c_i$ if he/she is at the point $x_i$ at the time $t_i$. Picking up a stone does not take any time. Each stone can be picked up at most once.

The score of a player is defined as the sum of values of stones he/she has picked up. The score of a number of players is simply the sum of their individual scores. Devise a strategy for the players to gain the maximum total score.

You should find the maximum possible total score for each number of players $p$ between $1$ and $K$ inclusive.
