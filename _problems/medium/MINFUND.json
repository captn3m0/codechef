This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq c \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$ and $u_i \\neq v_i$\n- $2 \\leq \\sum n \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq \\sum m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$\n- There is atmost one road between any $x$ and $y$.","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"The input is divided into multiple subtasks.

A subset of these houses $S$ is called a *city* if any house in $S$ is reachable from any other house in $S$. Formally, a subset of houses $S$ is a city if $x$ and $y$ are reachable from each other for all $x, y \\in S$. The funding required for a city $S$ consisting of $k$ houses is defined as $k^2$.\n\nThe president has given the mayor Saarang an order: divide the country into $2$ cities with **exactly one road** connecting them. In other words, divide the country into two cities $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that:\n- Each house $i$ either belongs to $S_1$ or $S_2$.\n- There exists a single road connect a house $x$ from $S_1$ and a house $y$ from $S_2$.\n\nFor this purpose, you are allowed to build more bi-directional roads. The funding required to build a road between any $2$ houses is $c$.\n\nSaarang, however, is busy preparing for his board exams so he requests you to solve this problem for him. Find the **minimum total funding** required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or $-1$ if no division is possible.\n\n**Note:** The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the $2$ cities and the roads built.
