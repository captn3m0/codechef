Vivek loves to play with sequences and XORs, so he challenges you to solve the following problem.

You are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given a subsequence $A_L, A_{L+1}, \ldots, A_R$; the answer to this query is $\sum_{i=L}^R A_i \oplus (i-L)$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- The next $Q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€• the answer to the query.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le Q \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le L \le R \le N$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (30 points):** $1 \le N, Q \le 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (70 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
3 2
3 1 2
1 3
2 3
```

### Example Output
```
3
4
```

### Explanation
The answer to the first query is $A_1 \oplus 0 + A_2 \oplus 1 + A_3 \oplus 2 = 3$.
