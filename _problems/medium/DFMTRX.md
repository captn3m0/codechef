Dr.D is now fond of matrices. He is particularly interested in Doofish Matrices. A Doofish Matrix of order $N$ is a matrix with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered $1$ through $N$) such that:
- Each element of this matrix is an integer between $1$ and $2N-1$ inclusive.
- For each $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i \le N$, $1 \le j \le 2N-1$), the integer $j$ appears in the $i$-th row and/or in the $i$-th column.

Now, for a given $N$, Dr.D is wondering if there is a Doofish Matrix of order $N$. Find such a matrix or determine that it does not exist. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

### Output
For each test case:
- First, print a line containing the string `"Hooray"` if a Doofish Matrix of order $N$ exists or `"Boo"` if it does not.
- If it exists, print $N$ more lines describing one such matrix. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain $N$ space-separated integers â€• the elements in the $i$-th row.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 2,000$
- the sum of $N^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \cdot 10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (29 points):** $N$ is a power of $2$

**Subtask #2 (71 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
1
2
```

### Example Output
```
Hooray
1
Hooray
3 1
2 3
```
