### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/bengali/LCKDSAFE.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/mandarin/LCKDSAFE.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/russian/LCKDSAFE.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/MARCH21/vietnamese/LCKDSAFE.pdf) as well.

Chef has met up with his old friend Jack recently. Jack told Chef that he found a recipe for an ancient dish, but unfortunately, it is locked in a safe and to open the safe, it is necessary to enter the solution to the following problem.

There is a sequence of non-negative integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ on the safe. Find the number of pairs $(l, r)$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq N$) which satisfy the condition $$(A_l \lor A_{l+1} \lor \ldots \lor A_r) \oplus (A_l \land A_{l+1} \land \ldots \land A_r) \geq \max(A_l, A_{l+1}, \ldots, A_r) \,.$$

Here, $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR, $\lor$ denotes bitwise OR and $\land$ denotes bitwise AND.

Jack and Chef cannot think of anything except the recipe, so you are asked to open the safe.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of pairs $(l,r)$ that satisfy the given condition.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $0 \leq A_i \lt 2^{60}$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** for each valid $i$, $A_i$ is a power of $2$

**Subtask #2 (30 points):**
- $A_i \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$

**Subtask #3 (60 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
2
4
0 1 2 3
6
1 3 5 6 4 2
```

### Example Output
```
6
11
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The pairs $(l, r)$ satisfying the condition are $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(1, 3)$, $(1, 4)$, $(2, 3)$ and $(2, 4)$.
