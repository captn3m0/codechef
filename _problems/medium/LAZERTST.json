Can you solve this problem too?\r\n\r\nLet's frame this problem formally. You are given integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $Q$. Consider a random sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$, where each element is generated independently and uniformly randomly between $1$ and $M$ (inclusive). As described in the problem statement of LAZER, we create line segments between pairs of points $(i, A_i)$ and $(i+1, A_{i+1})$ for each valid $i$.\r\n\r\nThe *height* of a line segment connecting points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is defined as $|y_1-y_2|$. You are given $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given integers $L$ and $R$; you should consider the line segments such that the $x$-coordinates of their endpoints lie between $L$ and $R$ inclusive, and you should find the maximum of heights of these segments.\r\n\r\nYour task is to answer these queries. However, the sequence $A$ is hidden and you may only ask at most $K$ questions (of a different type from the queries you should answer). In each of your questions:\r\n- You should choose integers $x_1$, $x_2$ and $y$, where $1 \\le x_1 \\lt x_2 \\le N$ and $1 \\le y \\le 10^9$.\r\n- Consider a laser beam fired horizontally to the right from the point $(x_1,y)$, which stops at the point $(x_2,y)$ and does not propagate further.\r\n- This beam collides with zero or more of the line segments described above. The beam is considered to collide with a line segment if it intersects or touches this segment, except when the left endpoint of this segment is $(x_2, y)$ or its right endpoint is $(x_1, y)$.\r\n- The answer to this question is the maximum of heights of the segments with which it collides or the information that it does not collide with any segments.\r\n\r\n### Interaction\r\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows.\r\n- For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing four space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $K$ and $Q$. \r\n- Then, you should read $Q$ lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$ describing one of the queries which you should answer.\r\n- Then, you may ask questions.\r\n    - To ask a question, you should print a line containing four space-separated integers $1$, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $y$.\r\n    - Then, you should read a line containing a single integer $H$.\r\n    - If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, $H = -1$.\r\n    - Otherwise, if the beam in this question does not collide with any segments, then $H = -2$.\r\n    - Otherwise, $H$ is the maximum of heights of the segments with which the beam collides.\r\n- When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing $Q + 1$ space-separated integers $2$, $ans_1$, $ans_2$, ..., $ans_Q$, where for each valid $i$, $ans_i$ is the answer to the $i$-th query. This does not count as a question.\r\n- Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: $1$ if your answer is correct or $-1$ if it is incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\r\n\r\nNote that when you receive $-1$ (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n- $T = 10$\r\n- $Q = 10$\r\n- $1 \\le L \\lt R \\le N$\r\n\r\n### Subtasks\r\n**Subtask #1 (30 points):**\r\n- $N = 20,000$\r\n- $2 \\le M \\le 10$\r\n- $R - L \\ge 1,000$\r\n- $K = 3$ \r\n\r\n**Subtask #2 (30 points):**\r\n- $N = 2,000$\r\n- $M = 10^9$\r\n- $R - L \\ge 100$\r\n- $K = 100$ \r\n\r\n**Subtask #3 (40 points):** \r\n- $N = 2,000$\r\n- $M = 10^9$ \r\n- $R - L \\ge 100$\r\n- $K = 10$ \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```\r\nGrader          You\r\n1\r\n4 2 2 3\r\n1 2\r\n3 4\r\n1 4\r\n                1 1 2 1\r\n0                                                               \r\n                1 3 4 2\r\n1\r\n                2 0 1 1\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n**Example case 1:** The hidden sequence $A$ is $[1,1,1,2]$. Since by asking $x_1=1$, $x_2=2$ and $y=1$, we got the answer $0$, it obviously means that the answer to the first query is $0$. Similarly, since by asking $x_1=3$, $x_2=4$ and $y=2$, we got the answer $1$, which is the largest possible height of a line segment here, the answer to the second query is $1$. The answer to the third query cannot be smaller than the answer to the second query, so it is also $1$.\r\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"","constraintsState":false,"subtasks":"","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/MARCH20\/hindi\/LAZERTST.pdf), [Bengali](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/MARCH20\/bengali\/LAZERTST.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/MARCH20\/mandarin\/LAZERTST.pdf), [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/MARCH20\/russian\/LAZERTST.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/MARCH20\/vietnamese\/LAZERTST.pdf) as well.\r\n\r\n**This is an interactive problem.**\r\n\r\nWhen Vivek was creating the problem LAZER, he realised that it can be used to create a different, interactive problem.
