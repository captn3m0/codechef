More specifically, the probability of a ball being taken out of the bag is equal to it's volume divided by the sum of volumes of all the balls in the bag at that point.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are bored and decide to play a game. It has <b>N<\/b> Rounds. In the i-th Round, you want to find the ball numbered i. To do so, you take out balls one by one, <b>without replacement<\/b>, till you take out the ball numbered i. Then the Round ends, and you place all the balls back into the bag and proceed with the next Round.<\/p>\n\n<p>You need to find, for each Round, what is the expected number of balls you would need to remove.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that during a single Round, you do not replace any balls you remove. However, every Round starts from scratch with all the balls put in.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of each input contains a single integer <b>N<\/b>, the number of balls in the bag.<\/li>\n<li>The second line contains <b>N<\/b> integers, the i<sup>th<\/sup> integer representing the volume of the i<sup>th<\/sup> ball.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Print <b>N<\/b> space separated values on a single line where the i<sup>th<\/sup> value is the expected number of balls you remove in Round i. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than or equal to 10<sup>-6<\/sup> for each ball.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 10<sup>3<\/sup><\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 ball volumes \u2264 10<sup>9<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3 5\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1.625000 1.375000\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>Finding expected number of balls removed in Round 1: The probability of extracting the first ball in the first try is 3\/8. Therefore, we will either extract 1 ball with probability 3\/8 or two balls with probability 5\/8. Expected number of balls extracted therefore is 3\/8 + 2 * (5\/8) = 1.625.<\/p> \n\n<p>Similarly for the second ball, 5\/8 + 2 * (3\/8) = 1.375<\/p>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"grebnesieh","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #D0011B;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>7&#9733;<\/span><span>grebnesieh<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"15-12-2017","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/grebnesieh'>grebnesieh<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/gwr17rol'>gwr17rol<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/medium'>medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/probability'>probability<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1516482000,"submit_start_date":1516482000,"visible_start_date":1516482000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525198954},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}
