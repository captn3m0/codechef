<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>A balanced parenthesis string is defined as follows:
- The empty string is balanced
- If `P` is balanced, `(P)` is also balanced
- If `P` and `Q` are balanced `PQ` is also balanced

`"()"`, `"(())()"` are examples of balanced parenthesis strings while `"(()"`, `"())"` are not balanced.

A substring of a string is a contiguous subsection of the given string.

Given $n$ and $k$, output a balanced parenthesis string of length $n$ having exactly $k$ substrings which are also balanced. If no such string is possible, output `"impossible"` without quotes. If there are multiple answers, print any.

###Input:

- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, which has two integers, $n$ and $k$, separated by space

###Output:
For each testcase, output any balanced parenthesis string which satisfies the condition or `"impossible"` if no such string exists.

###Constraints 
- $1 \leq T \leq 5000$
- $1 \leq n \leq 200$
- $1 \leq k \leq 10^5$

###Sample Input:
	3
	2 1
	5 3
	6 4

###Sample Output:
	()
	impossible
	()(())
	
###EXPLANATION:
Case 1: The entire string is also considered as its own substring so there is exactly 1 balanced substring: `()` itself

Case 2: No balanced string with length 5 exists

Case 3: There are exactly 4 substrings that are balanced (indices are 0 based):
1. Substring 0 to 1: `()`
2. Substring 3 to 4: `()`
3. Substring 2 to 5: `(())`
4. Substring 0 to 5: `()(())`
