In Chefland, each citizen has their own personal string. Chef is no exception. Recently, his string broke and he went to a shop to get a new one.

There are two strings in the shop: $A$ and $B$. Chef may choose any substring $A_s$ of $A$ (possibly empty) and any substring $B_s$ of $B$ (also possibly empty). Then, the shop assistant cuts these substrings out and sells a single string $C = A_s + B_s$ (here, $+$ denotes string concatenation) to Chef. For example, if $A$ is "aba" and $B$ is "cde", then some of the strings Chef can buy are "ba", "bac", "bacd", "ae", "d", "acde", "aba", "cde" or "abacde".

Chef has seen a lot of strings in his life and he liked exactly $N$ of them (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these strings is denoted by $S_i$ and according to Chef, it has a *beauty* $b_i$. Let's denote the number of substrings of $C$ that are equal to $S_i$ by $cnt_i(C)$. If Chef buys a string $C$, he says that the *pleasure* he gets from this string is $\sum_{i=1}^N cnt_i(C) \cdot b_i$.

What is the maximum possible pleasure Chef can get from a string he buys in the shop?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $A$.
- The second line contains a single string $B$.
- The third line contains a single integer $N$.
- The following $N$ lines describe Chef's favourite strings. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string $S_i$, followed by a space and an integer $b_i$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum pleasure.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le |A|, |B| \le 10^3$
- $1 \le N \le 10^4$
- $1 \le |S_i| \le 26$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le b_i \le 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- $A, B, S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$ contain only lowercase English letters
- $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$ are pairwise distinct
- the sum of $|A|$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^3$
- the sum of $|B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^3$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^4$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (20 points, time limit 2 seconds):** $|A|, |B|, N \le 100$

**Subtask #2 (30 points, time limit 1 second):**
- the sum of $|A|$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$
- the sum of $|B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $500$

**Subtask #3 (50 points, time limit 1 second):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
1
hitech
codechef
3
chef 3
code 1
eche 5
```

### Example Output
```
13
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** Chef can buy the string $C$ = "tech" + "echef" = "techechef". In this string $C$, one substring is "chef", there are no substrings "code" and two substrings are "eche". Chef's pleasure in this case is $1 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 5 = 13$, which is the maximum possible pleasure.
