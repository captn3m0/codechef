This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $T = 500$\n- $N = 50$\n\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- 30 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10000$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n","subtasksState":false,"statement":"### Read problem statements in [Mandarin](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/mandarin\/GUESSROW.pdf), [Vietnamese](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/vietnamese\/GUESSROW.pdf), and [Russian](https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/translated\/SNCKPE21\/russian\/GUESSROW.pdf) as well.\n\nYou and Paolo are playing a game.\n\nPaolo, without letting you peek, writes down on a sheet of paper an $N\\times N$ matrix of $0$s and $1$s (all the $N^2$ entries are either $0$ or $1$) such that, for each $1 \\le k \\le N$, there is a row with exactly $k$ ones. In all tests, $N = 50$.\n\nYour goal is to find the row with exactly $\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2} \\rfloor$ ones.\nIn order to do it, you may ask the following kind of question to Paolo: <i> Paolo, what's the value in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column? <\/i>\n \nThe question is valid if $1\\le i,j\\le N$.\n\nYou have to play $T = 500$ games and, in total, you can ask at most $610T$ questions.\n\n### Interaction Format\n\nFirst, read two integers $T$ ($T=500$) and $N$ ($N=50$). They are fixed but still provided, just for your comfort.\n\nNow, you start playing games. As soon as you give the answer to a game you should immediately start playing the next one.\n\nTo ask a question (of the kind described in the statement), you should print '? $i$ $j$' (without quotes). After this, you should read an integer, the value of the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column. A question is valid if $1\\le i\\le N$ and $1\\le j\\le N$.\n\nWhen you have identified the row with exactly $\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\rfloor$ ones, you should print '! $i$' (without quotes), where $i$ is the index of the row ($1\\le i\\le N$).\n\nIf you perform a malformed query, or you identify a row that does not have $\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2} \\rfloor$ ones, the interactor terminates immediately and your program receives verdict <tt>Wrong Answer<\/tt>. If you ask more than $610T$ questions, the interaction continues until you have played all the games and then your program receives a verdict <tt>Wrong Answer<\/tt>.\n\nA program in <tt>C++<\/tt> which uses <tt>cin<\/tt> and <tt>cout<\/tt> (and flushes the output after every question) needs $\\approx 700$ms to perform $610T=305000$ questions (considering only the time spent interacting).\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive (i.e., the $T$ matrices are chosen before the beginning of the interaction).\n\n\n\n### Note\n\nInstead of providing a sample case that shows the interaction, we provide <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.githubusercontent.com\/dario2994\/dfe55c532f93b20d4bdbafa0c97b488d\/raw\/a36ad7adc53480f61f3409c54a8ff39211698eff\/guessrow_template.cpp\">an implementation in C++<\/a>  of a program that performs the interaction correctly and answers correctly (but it makes too many questions and therefore receives a verdict <tt>Wrong Answer<\/tt>).\n","inputFormat":"- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.
