Pantelija was given a sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. Let's define the *gcd value* of this sequence as the number of its non-empty contiguous subsequences with greatest common divisor strictly greater than $1$. The greatest common divisor of any contiguous subsequence $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le N$) is the greatest positive integer which divides each element of this subsequence.

Pantelija wants to maximise the gcd value of this sequence. In order to do that, he may choose a valid index $i$, an integer $b$ ($1 \le b \le 5 \cdot 10^5$, since he does not like large numbers) and change the element $a_i$ to $b$. What is the maximum possible gcd value he can obtain?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$.

### Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€• the largest possible gcd value.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^4$
- $1 \le a_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (15 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le a_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #2 (35 points):**
- $1 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^4$
- $1 \le a_i \le 500$ for each valid $i$

**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
