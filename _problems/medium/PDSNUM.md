<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>A positive integer is called a "PDS Number" if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits. Let PDS(N) be the N-th PDS Number (indexed from 1), you are requested to calculate it.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are several test cases (at most 10000), each formed as follows:
<ul>
<li>The first and only line contains a positive integer N (N â‰¤  10<sup>9</sup>).</li>
</ul>
The input is ended by N = 0.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a line the respective PDS(N) calculated.
</p>
