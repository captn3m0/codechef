Chef is busy preparing for the next lunchtime so he has given you the following task.  

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of positive integers. The $goodness$ of the array $a$ is defined as the $GCD$ of all the elements in the array.
Formally $goodness = GCD(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$. 

You can perform the following type of operation:

- Select any two elements of the array $a_i$ and $a_j$. ($i \ne j$ and $ 1 \leq i, j \leq n$)

- Replace both $a_i$ and $a_j$ with $a_i\cdot a_j$
 
You can perform this operation **at-most once**. Find the **maximum goodness** of the array.
