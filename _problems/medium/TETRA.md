<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3>
<p align="justify">Given the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron calculate the radius of a sphere inscribed in that tetrahedron (i.e. a sphere tangent to all the faces).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p align="justify">An integer t, 1&lt;=t&lt;=30, denoting the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing 6 integers describing the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron separated by single spaces. The edges are not longer than 1000 and for the tetrahedron WXYZ, the order of the edges is: WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p align="justify">t lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal precision equal to the radius of a sphere inscribed in the given tetrahedron.</p>
