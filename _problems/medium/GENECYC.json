This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$\n- The sum of $k$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$\n- $1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$\n- The given graph is a simple graph, i.e. there are no self loops or multiple edges","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"**Subtask 1 (100 pts):** Original constraints ","subtasksState":true,"statement":"A vertex-induced subgraph of a simple graph $G$ is one that can be obtained from $G$ by removing some (possibly, none) vertices. When a vertex is removed, all edges incident to it must also be removed.\n\nA vertex-induced cycle is a vertex-induced subgraph that is also a cycle.\n\nEquivalently, a cycle $C$ is vertex induced, if for every edge $e$ in the graph $G$ that does not belong to $C$, **at most** one of its ends lies on $C$. \n\nYou are given a **simple** undirected graph $G$ with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges. Each edge has a label that is either $0$ or $1$. \n\nIn one move, you can select any vertex-induced cycle in $G$ and flip the values of the label in all edges of the cycle, (i.e. change every $0$ to a $1$ and every $1$ to a $0$). \nThe cost of one such move is equal to the size (i.e. number of edges) of the cycle. \nThe total cost for a sequence of moves is the sum of the costs of each individual move.\n\nDetermine if there exists a sequence of moves after which all edges have label $0$.
