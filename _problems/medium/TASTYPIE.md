Chef, who is a chef by profession as well, has created $N$ pies (enumerated $1$ through $N$), and has placed them in a row. Now he wants to taste all the pies. But by following a peculiar order of tasting.

In each tasting, he may decide (randomly and independently) to eat either the current leftmost pie or the rightmost pie, and eats that pie.

Eg: If $N = 7$, then one valid order of tasting the pies is $(1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 6, 5)$

But he can't wait to taste all of them, so for each $i$ $(1 \leq i \leq N)$, he wants to know the **expected value** of the number of tasting at which he'll eat the $i^{th}$ pie.

Obviously, you'll have to do this for him because he's busy eating!

### Input
- First line contains $T$ - the number of test cases
- Each test case contains $N$ -  the number of pies he made

### Output
For each test case, print $N$ numbers, the expected number of tastings after which he'll eat the $i^{th}$ pie.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$

### Sample Input
```
1
3
```

### Sample Output
```
1.75 2.5 1.75
```
