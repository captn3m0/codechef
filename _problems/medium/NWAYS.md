All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME24/mandarin/NWAYS.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME24/russian/NWAYS.pdf).

Devu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point **(c,d)** from point **(a,b)** in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point **(c,d)** from the point **(a,b)** using **abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d)** steps only.

Devu has two sets of points. Set **A** contains points having **X** co-ordinate 0 and **Y** co-ordinates varying from **1** to **N**(both inclusive). Set **B** contains points having **X** co-ordinate **K** and **Y** co-ordinates varying from **1** to **N**(both inclusive). Both sets contains **N** number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set **B** from the each point of set **A** .

As the answer can be large, print it modulo **1000000007**.

### Input

- First line of input contains an integer **T** denoting number of test cases.
- Next **T** lines will contain pair of integers **N** and **K**
### Output

For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.

### Constraints

**Subtask #1: 10 points**

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 1000**

**Subtask #1: 10 points**

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 106**

**Subtask #3: 80 points**

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ N,K ≤ 106**

### Example


<pre><b>Input:</b>
2
2 2
4 5

<b>Output:</b>
8
236
</pre>
### Explanation

For the first sample case,

ways\[(0,1)-&gt;(2,1)\]= 1

ways\[(0,2)-&gt;(2,2)\]= 1

ways\[(0,1)-&gt;(2,2)\]= 3

ways\[(0,2)-&gt;(2,1)\]= 3

**So, the total number of ways = 8.**
