All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME10/mandarin/SHGAME.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME10/russian/SHGAME.pdf).

Yuuko and Nagi like to play the following game:

Initially they take a checkered sheet of paper of the size of **N** x **M** cells. Then, one cell, let's call this cell (**X**, **Y**) is marked. Then, they take the moves alternately. A move consists of making a long horizontal or vertical cut. This cut should coincide with one of the lines that divide the sheet into cells. Then, a part that doesn't contain a marked cell is thrown away and another player takes her turn. A player who is unable to make a turn because after the opponent's turn the dimensions of the sheet became equal to **1** x **1** loses. Yuuko plays first.

Yuuko and Nagi have played a lot of games together so now they both know the optimal strategy and always use it. Today girls are going to play a game on a **N** x **M** cells sheet of paper, but they haven't yet decided, what is the cell (**X**, **Y**) to be marked. Yuuko is interested, in how many ways it's possible to choose this cell so the she can become a winner, regardless of Nagi's moves.

### Input

The first line of input consists of an integer **T** - the number of test cases. Then, **T** lines describing the test cases follow. The **i**-th such line contains two integers **N** and **M**, separated by a single space.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to choose the marked cell in order to ensure Yuuko's win.

### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
2
5 8
6 7

<b>Output:</b>
40
42
</pre>
### Scoring

**T** = 100, 1 &lt;= **N**, **M** &lt;= 10 : 25 points.

**T** = 100, 1 &lt;= **N**, **M** &lt;= 1000 : 36 points.

**T** = 100, 1 &lt;= **N**, **M** &lt;= 106 : 39 points.
