All submissions for this problem are available.\*\*Jaime Lannister\*\* has abandoned his sister and lover \*\*Cersei\*\*, and now has come to Winterfell to fight against \*\*the army of the dead\*\*. He along with others has to study the weaknesses of White Waker Army. This can be done by monitoring $N$ strings. The $N$ strings are $A\_1, A\_2, \\ldots, A\_N$. $A\_i$ is said to be the string with index $i$. He with Bronn has to make a \*\*set S comprising all substrings of all of the $N$ strings\*\*. \*\*Note - Set always comprises unique elements.\*\* Let's say there are 2 strings \*\*abad\*\* and \*\*abab\*\*. \*\*Set S\*\* will be \*\*{ abad, aba, ab, a, bad, ba, b, ad, bab, d, abab }\*\*. Also, each substring mentioned in set \*\*S\*\* has \*\*parent strings\*\*, where each parent string is one of the initial $N$ strings. If $B$ is an element of $S$, then $A\_i$ is \*\*parent string\*\* of $B$ if $B$ is substring of $A\_i$. In the above mentioned example \*\*ab\*\* has both \*\*abab\*\* and \*\*abad\*\* as its parent strings. \*\*bad\*\* has just \*\*abad\*\* as its parent string. Jaime has to handle $Q$ different queries on these strings. Each query is of the following form - $X$ $Y$ Here $X (1\\leq X \\leq N)$ denotes the index of string among the $N$ given strings. He has to answer the following for each given query : 1. Consider the set S described above. Compute the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) of each of the substring in this set with $A\_X$. Find the \*\*number of those substrings which have this LCP of length $\\geq Y$\*\*. 2. Consider the \*\*parent strings\*\* for each of the substrings which satisfy the criteria in 1) mentioned above. \*\*Among all such parent strings, find the lexicograhpically smallest one.\*\* In the example mentioned above - Let's say \*\*ab\*\* and \*\*bad\*\* satisfy the criteria in 1), then lexicographically smallest among the parent strings \*\*(abab, abad)\*\* of these both \*\*(ab,bad)\*\* will be \*\*abab\*\*. If there are multiple lexicographically smallest parent strings, find the one with the \*\*smallest index\*\* and output this index. 3. Consider the \*\*parent strings\*\* for each of the substrings which satisfy the criteria in 1) mentioned above. \*\*Among all such parent strings, find the lexicograhpically largest one.\*\* In the example mentioned above - Let's say \*\*ab\*\* and \*\*bad\*\* satisfy the criteria in 1), then lexicographically largest among the parent strings \*\*(abab, abad)\*\* of these both \*\*(ab,bad)\*\* will be \*\*abad\*\*. If there are multiple lexicographically largest parent strings, find the one with the \*\*largest index\*\*. Help Jaime find the answer to all three of them for each of the query. ###Input: - First line will contain $N$, number of string. - $N$ lines follow, the i-th line containing $A\_i$. - Next line comprises $Q$ - the number of queries. - $Q$ lines follow. Each line has 2 space separated integers - $X$ and $Y$ as described above. ###Output: For each query, output three space separated integers as described above on a separate line. \*\*If for 2) and 3), there are no parent strings, print -1 for both 2) and 3) values.\*\* ###Constraints - Strings have lowercase characters \['a'-'z'\] - $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ - 1 $\\leq |A\_i| \\leq 10^5$ - Sum of length of all strings $\\leq 10^6$ - $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$ - $1 \\leq X \\leq N$ - $1 \\leq Y \\leq$ Sum of length of all strings ###Sample Input: 4 abad abab abab abad 2 1 1 2 2 ###Sample Output: 6 2 4 4 2 4 ###EXPLANATION: For 1st query, $A\_1$ is \*\*abad\*\*. The substrings in set $S$ which have LCP&gt;=1 with \*\*abad\*\* are \*\*{a, ab, aba, abad, abab, ad}\*\*. The parent strings of \*\*a\*\* = abad (index 1), abab (index 2), abab (index 3), abad (index 4). The parent strings of \*\*ab\*\* = abad (index 1), abab (index 2), abab (index 3), abad (index 4). The parent strings of \*\*aba\*\* = abad (index 1), abab (index 2), abab (index 3), abad (index 4). The parent strings of \*\*abad\*\* = abad (index 1), abad (index 4). The parent strings of \*\*abab\*\* = abab (index 2), abab (index 3). The parent strings of \*\*ad\*\* = abad (index 1), abad (index 4). Among all of these parent strings, \*\*lexicographically smallest\*\* are abab (index 2) and abab(index 3). The smallest of these indices is 2. Among all of these parent strings, \*\*lexicographically largest\*\* are abad (index 1) and abad(index 4). The largest of these indices is 4.
