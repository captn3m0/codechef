### Read problem statements in [Hindi](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/hindi/SUMXOR2.pdf), [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/bengali/SUMXOR2.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/mandarin/SUMXOR2.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/russian/SUMXOR2.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/FEB21/vietnamese/SUMXOR2.pdf) as well.

You are given a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query:
- You are given a positive integer $M$.
- Consider all non-empty subsequences of $A$ with length $\le M$. Recall that a subsequence is any sequence that can be created by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- For each of these subsequences, compute the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of its elements. Your task is to determine the sum of these values. Since this sum can be very large, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- The third line contains a single integer $Q$.
- $Q$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer $M$ describing a query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€• the sum of bitwise XORs for all subsequences of $A$ with length $\le M$, modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \lt 2^{30}$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \leq M \leq N$

### Subtask
**Subtask #1 (10 points):** $1 \leq N, Q \leq 1,000$

**Subtask #2 (90 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
1 3 5 2
2
1
2
```

### Example Output
```
11
34
```

### Explanation
In the first query, the answer is just the sum of elements of $A$ (modulo $998,244,353$), which is $1+3+5+2 = 11$.

In the second query, the answer is the sum of bitwise XORs for all subsequences with length $1$ or $2$, which is $1+3+5+2 + (1 \oplus 3) + (1 \oplus 5) + (1 \oplus 2) + (3 \oplus 5) + (3 \oplus 2) + (5 \oplus 2) = 34$.
