Chefina gave Chef a sequence $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N$ as a birthday present. She constructed it from a sequence of positive integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ in the following way: for each valid $i$, $F_i = \sum_{j=1}^i (-1)^{(j+1)} \cdot A_j$.

Unfortunately, Chef was playing with the sequence $F$ and shuffled it. Now, he has a sequence denoted by $B$, but he does not remember $F$. The only things he knows are that $F$ is a permutation of $B$ and among all such permutations which Chefina could have constructed, her sequence $F$ was the lexicographically smallest.

Chef does not want to disappoint Chefina, but he is too busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to help him recover $F$. Find the sequence $F$ he got from Chefina or determine that he made another mistake and a sequence that satisfies the given conditions does not exist.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$.

### Output
For each test case:
- If there is no solution, print a single line containing the string `"NO"` (without quotes).
- Otherwise, print two lines.
- The first of these lines should contain the string `"YES"` (without quotes).
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $|B_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (50 points):** $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$ are pairwise distinct

**Subtask #2 (50 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
4
2
1 2
3
-1 -2 -3
4
3 3 3 4
4
4 -4 4 -4
```

### Example Output
```
YES
2 1
NO
NO
YES
4 -4 4 -4
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** The only two permutations of $B$ are $[1,2]$ and $[2,1]$. Out of them, $[1,2]$ could not have been generated by Chefina, since it would require $A = [1,-1]$, which contains a negative element. On the other hand, for $[2,1]$, we get $A = [2,1]$, so $F = [2,1]$ must be the sequence Chefina generated.
