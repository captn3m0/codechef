<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Chef Dengklek will open a new restaurant in the city. The restaurant will be open for N days. He can cook M different types of dish. He would like to cook a single dish every day, such that for the entire N days, he only cook at most K distinct types of dishes.</p>
<p>In how many ways can he do that?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line consisting of three integers N, M, K.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line consisting the number of different ways he can cook for the entire N days, modulo 1000000007.</p>
