{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Chef has had a recipe. He had written it as a sequence of <b>N<\/b> integer numbers <b>A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]<\/b>. To be on the safe side, he decided to write out <b>M<\/b> triples of numbers, where <b>i<\/b>-th triple is composed of three numbers <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>-th to <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>-th is equal to <b>Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. In other words, <b>A[X<sub>i<\/sub>] +  A[X<sub>i<\/sub> + 1] + ... + A[Y<sub>i<\/sub>] = Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. Unfortunately, the recipe has been recently lost. So Chef needs to restore his recipe using these <b>M<\/b> triples. Your task is to help him.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line contains two space separated integer numbers <b>N<\/b> and <b>M<\/b>.<br \/>\nThen <b>M<\/b> lines follow. Each line contains three space separated integer numbers <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> and <b>Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>. It means that the sum of numbers in the recipe from <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>-th to <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>-th is equal to <b>Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>If there is a solution output <b>N<\/b> space separated integer numbers - the sequence that you have restored. If there are several solutions you can output any of them. However, any number in the output should be no more than 10<sup>14<\/sup> by its absolute value. If it is impossible to restore the sequence output \"-1\" without quotes.\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 65536<br \/><\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>M<\/b> \u2264 200000<br \/><\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> \u2264 <b>Y<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b><br \/><\/li>\n<li>|<b>Z<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>| \u2264 1000000000 (10<sup>9<\/sup>)<\/li>\n<li>If It is possible to restore the sequence then there is way to do this such that every number in the restored sequence is in range [-10000; 10000]<\/li><br \/>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input 1:<\/b>\n4 4\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 4 -2\n1 4 1                                                                            \n\n<b>Output 1:<\/b>\n1 2 -1 -1\n\n<b>Input 2:<\/b>\n5 3\n1 3 4\n4 5 6\n1 5 9 \n\n<b>Output 2:<\/b>\n-1\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\nIn the first test case the answer is not unique. Possible answers are also <b>{0, 3, -2, 0}<\/b>, <b>{2, 1, 0, -2}<\/b> and many others.\n<br \/><br \/>\nIn the second test case first two conditions imply <b>A[1] + A[2] + A[3] = 4<\/b> and <b>A[4] + A[5] = 6<\/b> and hence <b>A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] = (A[1] + A[2] + A[3]) + (A[4] + A[5]) = 4 + 6 = 10<\/b>. And it contradicts to the third condition. Hence it is impossible to restore the recipe.<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"RSRECIPE","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"RSRECIPE"}
