### Read problem statements in [Bengali](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/bengali/ALTLG.pdf), [Mandarin Chinese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/mandarin/ALTLG.pdf), [Russian](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/russian/ALTLG.pdf), and [Vietnamese](https://www.codechef.com/download/translated/AUG21/vietnamese/ALTLG.pdf) as well.

You are given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers. You have to answer $Q$ queries of the following two types:

- $1$ $L$ $R$ $(R > L)$ which asks you to find $\gcd(A_L, lcm(A_{L + 1}, \gcd(A_{L + 2}, ... , ((R - L) \bmod 2 == 1 ? $ $\gcd(A_{R - 1}, A_{R}) : lcm(A_{R - 1}, A_{R}))\ldots)))$.

- $2$ $L$ $R$ $(R > L)$ which asks you to find the same as above but $lcm$ swapped with $\gcd$ and vice-versa.

Here $lcm(a, b)$ and $\gcd(a, b)$ denotes the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$ respectively.

**Example:** Consider the array $A$ = $[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]$.

- Suppose a query is of the form $1$ $1$ $6$, so it asks you to find:
$\gcd(2, lcm(4, \gcd(8, lcm(16, \gcd(32, 64)))))$. 

- Suppose a query is of the form $2$ $1$ $5$, so it asks you to find:
$lcm(2, \gcd(4, lcm(8, \gcd(16, 32))))$. 

**Note:** Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
