This teaches him exponentiation.\n\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.\n\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.\n\nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.<\/div><\/aside>","problemComponents":{"constraints":"- $3 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}$\n- $3 \\leq K \\leq 10^4$\n","constraintsState":true,"subtasks":"- **Subtask $1$ (20 points)**: $3 \\leq K \\leq 300$, TL - $2$ sec\n- **Subtask $2$ (40 points)**: $3 \\leq K \\leq 1900$, TL - $8$ sec\n- **Subtask $3$ (10 points)**: $3 \\leq K \\leq 3000$, TL - $3$ sec\n- **Subtask $4$ (30 points)**: Original constraints, TL - $3$ sec\n","subtasksState":true,"statement":"**Please note that TLs are different for different subtasks.**\n\nMadoka decided to create her own chat with her friends in it. However, the chat was unmonitored for a while, so her friends started posting pictures of [manuls](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pallas%27s_cat) with numbers in it. Coming back to the messy chat, Madoka knows that she cannot suspend it now, because that will make her friends hate her. Instead, she wants to understand the rules her friends are using to post manuls.\n\nMadoka and her friends all have the same favorite number $K$. After a little investigation, she realized that her friends are posting manuls using the following rules:\n- Initially, a picture with only $1$ manul is posted.\n- If the last picture posted has $A$ manuls in it, then a picture with $B$ manuls will be posted next if the following conditions are met:\n    - $\\textbf{lcm}(A, B) \\leq A \\cdot (A + 1)$\n    - $A \\lt B \\le A + K$\n\nMadoka knows that her friends will stop counting when a picture with at least $N$ manuls is posted. Since this chat is hers, Madoka can suggest which picture to be posted each time. To not pollute the chat, Madoka is trying to find a sequence of pictures with the **minimum** number of pictures used.\n\nHelp Madoka!","inputFormat":"The only line of input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.","inputFormatState":true,"outputFormat":"Print the answer to the problem - the **minimum** number of pictures that can be used.","outputFormatState":true,"sampleTestCases":[{"id":"1","input":"4 3","output":"3","explanation":"Consider the following sequence, where each element is the number of manuls in each picture: $[1, 2, 4]$.\n\n- For the second picture with $2$ manuls:\n    - $\\mathbf{lcm}(1, 2) = 2 \\le 1 \\cdot (1 + 1)$\n    - $1 \\lt 2 \\le 1 + 3$\n- For the third picture with $4$ manuls:\n    - $\\mathbf{lcm}(2, 4) = 4 \\le 2 \\cdot (2 + 1)$\n    - $2 \\lt 4 \\le 2 + 3$\n\nNo shorter sequence of pictures is possible.","isDeleted":false},{"id":"2","input":"29 7","output":"7","explanation":"One of the shortest sequences of pictures is $[1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30]$.","isDeleted":false},{"id":"3","input":"228 17","output":"17","explanation":"","isDeleted":false}]},"video_editorial_url":"","languages_supported":"CPP14, C, JAVA, PYTH 3.6, CPP17, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, kotlin, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, swift, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, ICK, NICE, PRLG, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, SQLQ, NEM","max_timelimit":"2 - 8","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"fairy_winx","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span class='m-username--link'>fairy_winx<\/span>","problem_tester":"","problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"22-12-2021","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/fairy_winx'>fairy_winx<\/a>","problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","user_zen_mode":false,"best_tag":"","editorial_url":"","time":{"view_start_date":1640453400,"submit_start_date":1640453400,"visible_start_date":1640453400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1643797961},"user":{"username":null,"access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/search?q=MNULS","is_proctored":false,"is_user_verified_for_proctoring":null,"visitedContests":[]}
