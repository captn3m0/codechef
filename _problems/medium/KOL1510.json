Instead of entertaining her guest, Barfi Tai kept boasting about her <b>K<\/b> marvelous necklaces made of black and golden beads. Jalebi Bai felt really jealous of it and decided to exact revenge.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nShe has invited Barfi to visit her home next week. Meanwhile, she is planning to buy a truly beautiful necklace to make Barfi jealous. According to her, a truly beautiful necklace should contain each of Barfi\u2019s necklaces as a <b>subsequence<\/b> of it. Though still trying to show off, Jalebi Bai is smart and does not want to put a lot of money in it. So she wants to buy a truly beautiful necklace containing the minimum number of beads.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nShe goes to Devu Sunar and asks him to provide her such a necklace. Devu Sunar is busy this week and has asked you to help him in building the necklace. Please help him!\n<\/p>\n<h3>Note<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements but without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence [A,B,D] is a subsequence of [A,B,C,D,E,F].\n<\/li>\n<li>\nThe bead patterns on the necklaces are <b>not<\/b> considered circular.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
