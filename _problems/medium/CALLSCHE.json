He has a large number of empoyees in his team. Each of them spends their time participating in meetings, talking to clients over the phone, and a few other activities related to the job.<\/p>\n<p>Each person can spend an hour either in a meeting, talking to clients, or working on their project. Each hour must be dedicated to only one activity and in a single hour, a person cannot switch activities.<\/p>\n<p>There are <b>D<\/b> business days in the week, numbered <b>1<\/b> to <b>D<\/b>. Person <b>i<\/b> can spend at most <b>L<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> hours per week talking to clients. For each person, it is known which hours in their schedule are taken up by meetings.<\/p>\n<p>The call center responds to client for <b>H<\/b> hours per day, which, for simplicity, are numbered <b>1<\/b> through <b>H<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>For each hour in the week, the number of clients connecting to the call center for that hour is known. So, Chef knows that he needs exactly <b>R<sub>i,j<\/sub><\/b> people talking with clients during the day <b>i<\/b> and hour <b>j<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p><b>F<sub>k, i, j<\/sub><\/b> is equal to <b>1<\/b> if person <b>k<\/b> is available to talk to clients during hour <b>j<\/b> of day <b>i<\/b> and <b>0<\/b> if they have a meeting during that time.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that Chef lives in an alien world, which may not have 24 hours in a day or 7 days in a week.<\/p>\n<p>Chef needs to create a schedule for each person. Remember that there is a lunch period every day, from <b>LT<sub>begin<\/sub><\/b> to <b>LT<sub>end<\/sub><\/b> hours, both inclusive , so please make sure that each person will have at least one hour of free time during the designated lunch period.<\/p>\n<p>If some person doesn't have a meeting during an hour and they don't talk to a client as well during that hour, they can work on a corporate project and this hour will count as a working hour. Alternatively, they may spend this time working on a personal project and it will not count as a working hour.<\/p>\n<p>Please help Chef find out if it is possible to create a schedule such that following conditions hold.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each person spends at most <b>N<\/b> hours per day being on meetings and speaking with clients.<\/li>\n<li>Each person spends at most <b>L<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> hours per week talking to clients.<\/li>\n<li>Each person has at least one hour during the lunch time free of client calls as well as meetings.<\/li>\n<li>For each hour <b>j<\/b> on the day <b>i<\/b>, there are exactly <b>R<sub>i,j<\/sub><\/b> people free to talk to clients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.
