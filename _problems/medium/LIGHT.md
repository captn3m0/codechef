All submissions for this problem are available.There are **N** lights above a road along the X-axis. The **i**-th light has **Xi** as its X-coordinate, and it is hung **Yi** above the road. The **i**-th light illuminates a triangular area, which is an isosceles triangle and its bottom edge is on the X-axis. The half of the top angle of the triangle is **Zi** degrees. (See the below figure)

You have an aircraft which can fly on a fixed height. Because of some unknown reasons, this aircraft can fly only under the light. Your task is to find the maximum possible height for your flight from **X**=**L** to **X**=**R**.

The lights do not block the aircraft, e.g. the aircraft can safely fly through a light.

![](http://www.codechef.com/download/light.png)### Input

The first line contains three parameters **N**, **L** and **R**.

The next **N** lines give the infomation about each light. The **i**-th line contains three numbers **Xi**, **Yi** and **Zi**.

### Output

Output the maximum height you can reach. The value must have an absolute error less than or equal to 0.000001 (10-6). It is guarenteed that you can make the flight with the positive height.

### Constraints

1 ≤ **N** ≤ 50000
-1000 ≤ **L** &lt; **R** ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ **Xi** ≤ 1000
0 &lt; **Yi** ≤ 1000
15 ≤ **Zi** ≤ 75
**N** is an integer, but all other input values can be non-integers.
