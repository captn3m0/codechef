An integer $X$ is *cool* if it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n">primitive root</a> modulo $X$.

The *coolness* of a non-empty set of $N$ distinct integers $S = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\}$ is the number of cool divisors of $\prod_{i=1}^N x_i$.

You are given four integers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$. Let $S$ be the set containing all integers between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive). Consider all non-empty subsets of $S$ with size between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive). Find the sum of values of coolness of all these subsets. Since this sum can be huge, compute it modulo $998,244,353$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$. 

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the total coolness modulo $998,244,353$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100,000$
- $1 \leq L \leq R \leq 100,000$
- $1 \leq A \leq B \leq 100,000$

### Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (10 points):**
- $R \leq 16$
- $B \leq 16$ 

**Subtask #2 (35 points):** $A = B$

**Subtask #3 (55 points):** original constraints

### Example Input
```
3
3 4 1 2
1 10 15 20
1 8 1 8
```

### Example Output
```
10
0
1703
```

### Explanation
**Example case 1:** We have S = $\{3,4\}$, which has the following $3$ non-empty subsets with sizes in the range $[1,2]$:
- $\{3\}$: coolness $2$, the cool divisors are $\{1,3\}$
- $\{4\}$: coolness $3$, the cool divisors are $\{1,2,4\}$
- $\{3,4\}$: coolness $5$, the cool divisors are $\{1,2,3,4,6\}$

**Example case 2:** There are no subsets with size in the range $[15,20]$, so the sum is $0$.
