All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese ](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME11/mandarin/TANDC.pdf) and [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME11/russian/TANDC.pdf).

Tracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called N-Cube, which involves three sections involving N.

Tracy gives Charlie a number N, and Charlie makes a list of Nth powers of integers in increasing order (1N, 2N, 3N.. so on). This teaches him exponentiation. 

Then Charlie performs the following subtraction game N times : Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if N was 6, the list proceeds as \[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... \] to \[63, 685, 3367 ...\], and so on 5 more times.

After the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the Nth element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*. 



After practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers **M** (where M is a prime) and **R** instead of just a single number N, and the game must start from **MR - 1** instead of N. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer K such that M K  divides this number. Since even K can be large, output K modulo 1000000007 (109+7).



**INPUT:**

First line will contain **T**, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow

Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers **M R**



**OUTPUT:**

For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Charlie to Tracy modulo 1000000007.



**CONSTRAINTS:**

1&lt;=T&lt;=1000

2&lt;=M&lt;=109

30 points : 1&lt;=R&lt;=10000

70 points : 1&lt;=R&lt;=109

M is a prime number



**SAMPLE INPUT:**

1

2 2



**SAMPLE OUTPUT:**

1



**EXPLANATION:**

This list is :
\[1,8,27,64,125..\] -&gt; \[7,19,37,61..\] -&gt; \[12,18,24..\] -&gt; \[6,6,6..\]. Number of times 2 divides 6 is 1. Hence the answer is 1.
