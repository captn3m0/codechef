<span class="solution-visible-txt">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>###Read problems statements in [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/russian/STRTF.pdf), [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/vietnamese/STRTF.pdf), [Hindi](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/hindi/STRTF.pdf), [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/mandarin/STRTF.pdf) and [Bengali](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/S19PETST/bengali/STRTF.pdf) as well.

You are given an integer sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

Let's define a transformation $f$. Applying $f$ on $A$ gives a new sequence $f(A) = [B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N]$, where $B_N = A_N$ and $B_i = A_i \oplus A_{i+1}$ for each valid $i$.

Next, let's denote the sequence obtained by starting with $A$ and applying the transformation $k$ times by $f^k(A)$. Formally, $f^0(A) = A$ and $f^{k+1}(A) = f(f^k(A))$ for any integer $k \ge 0$.

You should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given two integers $K$ and $X$; the answer to this query is $f^K(A)_X$, i.e. the $X$-th element of the sequence $f^K(A)$.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $K$ and $X$ describing one query.

### Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer â€” the answer to this query.

### Constraints 
- $1 \le N, Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ 
- $0 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for all valid $i$ 
- $0 \le K \le 10^9$
- $1 \le X \le N$
