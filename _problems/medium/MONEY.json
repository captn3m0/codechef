{"body":"\n<p>The Government of Byteland has decide to issue new currency notes with special protection features to commemorate a great mathematician. <br \/><br \/> It has decided to issue notes summing up to N such that all the sums from 1 to N should be possible to be made by selecting some of the notes. Also this has to be done in way such that if any note from 1 to N can be made in more than one way by combining other selected notes then that set of notes is not valid.<br \/><br \/> For example, with N = 7,<br \/><br \/> The valid sets are:<br \/> {1,1,1,1,1,1,1}<br \/> {1,1,1,4}<br \/> {1,2,2,2}<br \/> {1,2,4}<br \/><br \/> Invalid sets are:<br \/> {1,1,1,2,2} beacuse the sum adds up to 7 but 2 can be made by {1,1} and {2}, 3 can be made by {1,1,1} and {1,2}, 4 can be made by {1,1,2} and {2,2} and similarly 5, 6 and 7 can also be made in multiple ways using the same set.<br \/> {1,1,3,6} beacuse all from 1 to 7 can be uniquely made but the sum is not 7 (its 11).<br \/><br \/> Before implementing this idea of issuing these new set of notes, the Government wants to know how many possible valid sets are there for a given N. Your program should help the Government to find this out.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>First line will contain the number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=6666). <br \/> Each test case will have one line containing an integer N (&lt;= 2^31-1).<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each value of N output the total number of valid sets on a separate line.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n7\n111212121\n1000\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n4\n75\n13\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MONEY","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MONEY"}
