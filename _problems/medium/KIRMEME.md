All submissions for this problem are available.###  Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV16/mandarin/KIRMEME.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV16/russian/KIRMEME.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/NOV16/vietnamese/KIRMEME.pdf) as well.

Memeland is a country consisting of **N** cities. There are exactly **N - 1** undirected roads connecting pairs of cities and there is exactly one path between each pair of cities (a path is a sequence of distinct cities where consecutive cities in the sequence are connected by a road).

As the country is located in mountains, cities may be at different heights. The heigh of **i-th** city is **ai**.

Kirito is going to travel around Memeland. Kirito is an unusual man, thus he wants to travel only interesting routes. He calls a sequence of cities **i1, i2, ..., iK** an *interesting route* if:

- no two cities in the sequence are the same: i.e. **ij** ≠ **ij'** for any two **j** ≠ **j'**.
- cities **ij** and **ij+1** are connected by a road for each **1** ≤ **j** &lt; **K**.
- the number of indices **j** with **1** &lt; **j** &lt; **K** with **aij-1** &lt; **aij** &gt; **aij+1** is at least **L** and at most **R** for some given **L** and **R**.

Help Kirito count the number of interesting routes in Memeland.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer **N** denoting the number of cities in Memeland. The second line of each test case contains two integers: **L** and **R** described in the statement.

The third line of each test case contains **N** integers where **i-th** integer is **ai**, the height of **i-th** city. The final **N - 1** lines contain two integers denoting pairs of cities that are connected by roads.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer denoting amount of interesting routes.

### Constraints

- **1** ≤ **T** ≤ **20**
- **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **5\*104**
- **1** ≤ **L** ≤ **R** ≤ **107**
- **1** ≤ **ai** ≤ **107**

### Subtasks

- **Subtask 1:** **1** ≤ **N** ≤ **103** - **20 points**
- **Subtask 2:** **Original constraints** - **80 points**
