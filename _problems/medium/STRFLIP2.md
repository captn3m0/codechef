Every string in the actual test files will have a length of at least $20$, as stated by the constraints.\n\n**Test Case $1$:** The given string is $A = 10110$. Apart from the single character substrings and the substring $A[3:4] = 11$, all other substrings are valid first moves.\n\nThe sample output performs moves as follows:\n- First, flip the substring $A[1:4]$. Now, $A = 01000$.\n- Then, flip the substring $A[2:3]$. Now, $A = 00100$, which is the target string.\n\nNote that there are several other valid solutions, and any solution using no more than $\\lfloor 5/2 \\rfloor + 10 = 12$ moves will be accepted. For example, a sequence of $3$ moves is shown below:\n- Flip $A[1:5]$, giving $A = 01001$\n- Flip $A[4:5]$, giving $A = 01010$\n- Flip $A[2:4]$, giving $A = 00100$\n\n**Test Case 2:** The given string $A = 00000$ has no substring with both $0$ and $1$, consequently there are no moves possible. Therefore it is impossible to convert this string to $B = 11111$.\n\n**Test Case 3:** The given string $A = 00$ is already equal to $B$ and so no moves are required.","isDeleted":false}}},"video_editorial_url":"https://youtu.be/InmldNgvUkA","languages_supported":{"0":"CPP14","1":"C","2":"JAVA","3":"PYTH 3.6","4":"CPP17","5":"PYTH","6":"PYP3","7":"CS2","8":"ADA","9":"PYPY","10":"TEXT","11":"PAS fpc","12":"NODEJS","13":"RUBY","14":"PHP","15":"GO","16":"HASK","17":"TCL","18":"PERL","19":"SCALA","20":"LUA","21":"kotlin","22":"BASH","23":"JS","24":"LISP sbcl","25":"rust","26":"PAS gpc","27":"BF","28":"CLOJ","29":"R","30":"D","31":"CAML","32":"FORT","33":"ASM","34":"swift","35":"FS","36":"WSPC","37":"LISP clisp","38":"SQL","39":"SCM guile","40":"PERL6","41":"ERL","42":"CLPS","43":"ICK","44":"NICE","45":"PRLG","46":"ICON","47":"COB","48":"SCM chicken","49":"PIKE","50":"SCM qobi","51":"ST","52":"SQLQ","53":"NEM"},"max_timelimit":1,"source_sizelimit":50000,"problem_author":"utkarsh_adm","problem_tester":"aryanc403","date_added":"19-01-2022","tags":{"0":"constructive","1":"easy","2":"medium","3":"start22","4":"utkarsh_adm"},"problem_difficulty_level":"Unavailable","best_tag":"","editorial_url":"https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRFLIP2","time":{"view_start_date":1642613400,"submit_start_date":1642613400,"visible_start_date":1642613400,"end_date":1735669800},"is_direct_submittable":false,"problemDiscussURL":"https://discuss.codechef.com/search?q=STRFLIP2","is_proctored":false,"visitedContests":{},"layout":"problem"}

Tracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called $N$-Cube, which involves three sections involving $N$.

Tracy gives Charlie a number $N$, and Charlie makes a list of $N$-th powers of integers in increasing order $1^N, 2^N, 3^N, \dot, \text{so on}$. This teaches him exponentiation.

Then Charlie performs the following subtraction game $N$ times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if $N$ was 6, the list proceeds as $[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ]$ to $[63, 685, 3367 ...]$, and so on $5$ more times.

After the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the $N$-th element of the list. This number is the *value of the game*.

After practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers $M$ (where $M$ is a prime) and $R$ instead of just a single number $N$, and the game must start from $M_R - 1$ instead of $N$. Since the *value of the game* can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer $K$ such that $M_K$ divides this number. Since even $K$ can be large, output $K$ modulo 1000000007 ($10^9 + 7$).
