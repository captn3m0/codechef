<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Chef is organizing an online card game tournament and for this purpose he has to provide a card shuffling software. This software has to simulate the following shuffling process. A stack of N cards is placed face down on the table. Cards in the stack are ordered by value. Topmost card has value 1 and the one on the bottom has value N. To shuffle the cards we repeat the following steps M times:
<ol>
<li>take A cards from the top of the deck.</li>
<li>take another B cards from the top of the deck.</li>
<li>put the A cards, which you removed in the first step, back on top of the remaining deck.</li>
<li>take C cards from the deck</li>
<li>put the B cards, which you're still holding from the second move, <b>card by card</b> on top of the deck.</li>
<li>finally, return the block of C cards on top</li>
</ol>
Note: taking a block of cards from the top of the deck does not change their order. The entire block is removed in a single move and not card by card. The only exception is the fifth move, where you return cards one by one from the top.

<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>The first line contains integers N and M. The following M lines describe the moves by integers A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>i</sub> as described in the previous section.
</p><p>In the spirit of random card shuffling, all test cases were generated with uniform random distributions to select where to cut the deck of cards.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>In a single line output the cards in the deck after performing all the moves. Cards should be listed from top of the deck to bottom and separated by spaces.

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 100 000</li>
</ul>
