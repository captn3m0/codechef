<p>Johnny is the author of the famous open source software ByteDict (Bytelandian electronic dictionary).</p>
<p>Being a fan of the word game Scrabble, Johnny would like to make ByteDict useful for Scrabble training. Therefore, he has decided to implement the "Wildcard Matching" feature.</p>
<p>Wildcard matching allows ByteDict's users to search for words matching a given wildcard pattern. A wildcard pattern may include the characters '*' or '?' in addition to the characters of the alphabet. A '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence) and a '?' matches any single character.</p>
<p>To be more precise, a wildcard pattern is matched with a word if we can replace each '?' with an alphabet character and each '*' with a sequence of alphabet characters so that after replacement, the pattern becomes identical to the word.</p>
<p>Now, as usual, please help Johnny implement the feature!</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains a number t (about 2) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.</p>
<p>The first line contains two integers N and Q (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 55000, 1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 300) which are the number of words in the dictionary and the number of wildcard queries.</p>
<p>Each line in the next N lines contains a word from the dictionary. The alphabet consists of lower and uppercase characters as well as digits.</p>
<p>Each line in the next Q lines contains a wildcard pattern.</p>
<p>The length of each word does not exceed 25 and the length of each wildcard pattern does not exceed 5.</p>
<p>Each test case is separated by a blank line.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each wildcard query print a line containing the query itself and the number of words in the dictionary that match the query.</p>
<p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.</p>
