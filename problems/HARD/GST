A spanning tree of an undirected, connected graph (V,E) with vertex set V and edge set E is a subset of edges F such that the graph (V,F) is connected and has no cycles. After a few moments thought, one realizes that an equivalent way to say this is to say:
<ul>
   <li>1) |F| = |V| - 1</li>
   <li>2) For any non-empty subset of nodes S, the number of edges with <b>both</b> endpoints in S is does not exceed |S|-1.</li>
</ul>
</p><p></p><p>
There is a fairly simple algorithm that can determine if a set of edges F is indeed a spanning tree of a graph.  Simply check that |F| = |V| - 1 and that the graph (V,F) is connected using your favorite connectivity algorithm.

</p><p>
As in all topics in mathematics, the next step is to generalize what is known.  So, consider the following generalization of spanning trees.  Say a generalized spanning tree (GST) of a graph (V,E) is a function f from the set of edges E = {e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, ..., e<sub>M</sub>} to the real interval [0,1] such that the following conditions hold:
<ul>
   <li>1) f(e<sub>1</sub>) + f(e<sub>2</sub>) + ... + f(e<sub>M</sub>) = |V| - 1</li>
   <li>2) For any non-empty subset of nodes S, the sum of the f(e) values for edges e with <b>both</b> endpoints in S does not exceed |S|-1.</li>
</ul>
</p><p></p><p>
One can see that this generalizes the notion of a spanning tree since spanning trees (in the classical sense) correspond to GSTs by setting f(e) = 1 if e is in the spanning tree and f(e) = 0 if e is not in the spanning tree.

</p><p>
Your task is to determine if a given function is a GST of a given graph.

<h3>Input:</h3>
</p><p>
The first line contains a single integer T (about 20) indicating the number of test cases to follow.

</p><p>
Each test case begins with two integers N and M where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges. The following M lines describe the edges, one per line. Each line contains three values u, v, f where 1 &lt;= u, v &lt;= n are the endpoints of the edge and f is a rational number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  This rational number is the value of the edge in the proposed GST.

</p><p>
The rational numbers are always presented as n/d (even if d=1) where both n and d are non-negative and have no common factors.

</p><p>
The input graphs have no parallel edges or loops and are, of course, undirected. Consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line (including a blank line preceding the first case).

</p><p>
Bounds: 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50, 1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100, and no denominator of any fraction in the input exceeds 30.

<h3>Output:</h3>
</p><p>
If the function is a GST, you are to simply print a single line saying "GST".

</p><p>
If the first constraint (the sum of the values of all edges is N-1) is violated, then you should print a single line displaying just the number 1.

</p><p>
Otherwise, if constraint 1) holds but constraint 2) is violated for some non-empty set S, you should print three lines. The first line simply contains the integer 2. The second contains the size of a non-empty 
subset of the nodes whose corresponding constraint is violated. The third line lists the nodes (in any order) that are part of such a set with a violated constraint (the number of nodes is as reported in the second line).

</p><p>
If there are multiple non-empty sets whose constraints are violated, then any will do. Print a blank line after the output for each case.
