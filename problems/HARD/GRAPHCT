<p>Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph containing an edge e = (u,v) with u ≠ v. Let f be a function which maps every vertex in V\{u,v} to itself, and otherwise, maps it to a new vertex w. The contraction of e results in a new graph G′ = (V′,E′), where V′ = (V\{u,v})∪{w}, E′ = E\{e}, and for every x ∈ V, x′ = f(x) ∈ V′ is incident to an edge e′ ∈ E′ if and only if, the corresponding edge, e ∈ E is incident to x in G.</p>
<p>An undirected graph H is called a minor of the graph G if H is isomorphic to a graph that can be obtained by zero or more edge contractions on a subgraph of G.</p>
<p>A graph is connected if there exists a path between any two vertices. A biconnected graph is one which remains connected even after the removal of any one vertex and all edges incident to it.</p>
<p>A simple graph is one which does not have more than one edge between any pair of vertex, nor does it have an edge from a vertex to itself.</p>
<p>You need to count how many simple biconnected graphs having n vertices and m edges exist such that they do not have a cycle of length 5 as a minor. Two graphs are considered distinct if there exist vertices having labels i and j which are adjacent in the first graph, but not in the second graph.</p>
<p>Input :</p>
<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next lines contains two integers n and m.</p>
<p>Output :</p>
<p>Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case. For a test case, output the number of graphs as described in the question. Output the answer modulo 1000000007.</p>
