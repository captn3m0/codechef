For a given positive integer <b>N</b> find the number of all positive integers <b>X</b> such that <b>N</b> divides <b>X</b> and the number of all positive divisors of <b>X</b> (including <b>1</b> and <b>X</b>) is equal to <b>N</b>. If there exist infinitely many such numbers print <b>-1</b>.

<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p> The first line contains a single positive integer <b>T &lt;= 100</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer <b>N </b>, where <b>N &lt;= 10^18</b>.

<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p> For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
6
113
144

<b>Output:</b>
2
1
-1
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
In the first test case only numbers 12 and 18 have 6 divisors and are divisible by 6.
<br /><br />
In the second test case the only number is 113^112.
<br /><br />
In the third test case there are infinitely many of them.</p>
