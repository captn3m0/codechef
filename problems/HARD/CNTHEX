<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>Dexter wants to make a hexagon by using six sticks for sides from a collection of sticks of lengths <b>1, 2, 3, ... N</b>. Dexter will only make <b>valid</b> hexagons whose area is strictly positive.<br /><br /> He considers a hexagon "good" if the biggest stick has  <b>length at least L</b> and lengths of all the other sticks <b>are not more than X</b>.  A "good" hexagon does not have sticks of the <b>same length more than K times</b>.   How many ways he can make a "good" hexagon?<br /><br /> For example, when N=8, L=7, X=5, K=3: { 1,2,2,5,5,7 } is a good hexagon but {1,2,2,2,2,7}, { 1,2,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6,7} are not .<br /><br /> Two hexagons are considered different if their side length sets are different. For example {1,2,3,4,5,6} , {1,1,1,2,2,3} and {1,1,2,2,2,3} are all different   hexagons. But {1,2,3,4,5,6} and { 2,4,6,1,3,5} are not different.</p>
