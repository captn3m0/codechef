<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p>
You are given the first N terms of a sequence.
The remaining terms of the sequence are defined as follows:
<blockquote>
A [ i ] = number of j such that 0 ≤ j &lt; i and A[ j ] ≥ i - j
</blockquote>
The sequence is indexed starting at 0.
The first N terms of the sequence will each be equal to N-1, N, or N+1.</p>
<p>In addition to the first terms of the sequence, you will be given a number of queries.
For each query you are to calculate the value of the sequence at that index.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case begins with 2 integers N and Q on a line,
followed by a line with N integers (each equal to N-1, N, or N+1),
then a line with Q non-negative integers.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output Q integers on a line, one per query,
indicating the respective element of the sequence.</p>
