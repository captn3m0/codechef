We call an array of integers X of size N good if it can be partitioned into 2 arrays of size n/2, say p1[] and p2[], such that p1[0] + p2[0] = p1[1] + p2[1] = p1[2] + p2[2] = ... . Given an array Y, determine the size of its largest subset which is a good array.

<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>
The first line contains the integer N.

The next line contains N space separated integers, which are the elements of the array X.


<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>
One number which is the size of the greatest subset as mentioned in the problem statement.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
6

1 4 2 3 8 10 
<b>Output:</b>
4
<b>Explanation:</b>
The array {1,4,2,3} is good, since you can form p1[] = {1,2} and p2[] = {4,3}. (satisfying 1 + 4 = 2 + 3)
