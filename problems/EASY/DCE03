There are n numbers in a given expression.<br />

X1 X2 X3 ....  Xn<br />

What is the number of ways to put parenthesis in the expression.<br />

For n=4, the different ways are <br />
<pre>
(((x1.x2).x3).x4)
((x1.x2).(x3.x4))
(x1.((x2.x3).x4))
(x1.(x2.(x3.x4)))
((x1.(x2.x3)).x4)
</pre>

Hence the required answer would be 5.<br />


<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>The first line contains the number of test cases t &lt;=10.
Each of the next t lines contain single integers &lt;=1000 denoting n.


<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>Display t lines containg the number of ways to put parenthesis in the expression of length n modulo 10000.
