<br /><br />
1.Bob plays first and the two players alternate.
<br /><br />
2.In his/her turn ,a player can subtract from N any prime     number(including 1) less than N.The number thus obtained is the new N.
<br /><br />
3.The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game.
<br /><br />
Assuming both play optimally,who wins the game ?
<h3>Input format:</h3>
</p><p>The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the next lines contains an integer N.
<h3>Output format:</h3>
</p><p>Output T lines one for each test case,containing "ALICE" if Alice wins the game ,or "BOB" if Bob wins the game.
