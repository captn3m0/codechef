<p>One beautiful day, Johnny eagerly examined the interesting properties of squares. He did not forget you, his best friend and a talented programmer and thus made a problem about squares to challenge your programming ability. The problem is: given a set of N points in the plane, how many squares are there such that all their corners belong to this set?</p>
<p>Now let's show Johnny your skill!</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.</p>
<p>Each test case has the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line contains an integer N, the number of points in the given set (4     N     500).</li>
<li>Then N lines follow, each line contains two integers X, Y describing coordinates of a point (-50     X, Y     50).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print in a single line the number of squares that have vertices belong to the given set.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />1<br />7<br />0 0<br />0 1<br />1 0<br />1 1<br />1 2<br />2 1<br />2 2<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong><br />3<br /><br /><strong>Output details:</strong><br />The three squares are: <br />(0 0), (0 1), (1 1), (1 0)<br />(1 1), (1 2), (2 2), (2 1)<br />(0 1), (1 0), (2 1), (1 2)<br /></pre>
