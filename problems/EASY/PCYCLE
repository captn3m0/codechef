<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p> We consider <em>permutations</em> of the numbers 1,..., <em>N</em>
for some <em>N</em>.  By permutation we mean a rearrangment of the
number 1,...,<em>N</em>.  For example</p>

<pre>
2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8
</pre>

<p> is a permutation of 1,2,...,8.  Of course,</p>

<pre>
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
</pre>

<p> is also a permutation of 1,2,...,8.</p>

<p> We can "walk around" a permutation in a interesting way and here
is how it is done for the permutation above:</p>

<p> Start at position 1. At position 1 we have 2 and so we go to
position 2.  Here we find 4 and so we go to position 4.  Here we find
1, which is a position that we have already visited. This completes
the first part of our walk and we denote this walk by (1 2 4 1). Such
a walk is called a <em>cycle</em>.  An interesting property of such
walks, that you may take for granted, is that the position we revisit
will always be the one we started from! </p>

<p> We continue our walk by jumping to first unvisited position, in
this case position 3 and continue in the same manner. This time we
find 5 at position 3 and so we go to position 5 and find 7 and we go
to position 7 and find 3 and thus we get the cycle (3 5 7 3).  Next we
start at position 6 and get (6 6) and finally we start at position 8
and get the cycle (8 8). We have exhausted all the positions.  Our
walk through this permutation consists of 4 cycles.</p>

<p> One can carry out this walk through any permutation and obtain a
set of cycles as the result.  Your task is to print out the cycles
that result from walking through a given permutation.</p>

<p>Input format</p>

<p> The first line of the input is a positive integer <em>N</em>
indicating the length of the permutation. The next line contains
<em>N</em> integers and is a permutation of 1,2,...,<em>N</em>.</p>

<p> You may assume that <em>N</em>     1000.</p>

<p>Output format</p>

<p> The first line of the output must contain a single integer
<em>k</em> denoting the number of cycles in the permutation.  Line 2
should describe the first cycle, line 3 the second cycle and so on and
line <em>k</em>+1 should describe the kth cycle.</p>
