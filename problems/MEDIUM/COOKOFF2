The competition progresses with a number of one-on-one elimination rounds until only one chef remains.

Additionally, each chef begins with a positive number of prize tokens
(some chefs begin with more than others, based on their performance in a qualification round).
The winner of each cook-off receives all of the loser's prize tokens, and the loser is
awarded a prize based on the number of prize tokens he/she had accrued.</p>

<p>The final cook-off always receives the most publicity.
Your task it to compute the expected difference between the number of prize tokens of the final two
competitors before the final cook-off.
You will be given the number of tokens each chef begins with.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (at most 50).
Each test case consists of a single line, beginning with an integer C,
the number of chefs in the competition, followed by C positive integers each describing the number
of prize tokens a chef begins with.
The total number of prize tokens among all chefs will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output the expected difference in prize tokens, rounded to 6 places
after the decimal point.</p>
