According to folklore, the great mathematician Gauss was able to calculate the sum of the first 50 natural numbers in mere seconds. You are given a similar problem, where you have to calculate the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers. The only catch being that the the number 'n' can be really very large. You have to calculate the sum 1+2+...+n for a given value of 'n'. 

<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>
The first line consists of a number 't which specifies the number of test cases. 1&lt;=t&lt;=100. 't' lines follow with a number 'n' on each line. 'n' can have upto 20000 digits. 1&lt;=n&lt;=(10^20000). 

<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>
For each test case, output a number which represents the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
2
3
5
<b>Output:</b>
6
15
<b>Explanation</b>
The sum of the first 3 numbers is 1+2+3 = 6
The sum of the first 5 numbers is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
