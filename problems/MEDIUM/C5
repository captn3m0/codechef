<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. </h3><p> For two given sequences of integers, find the longest possible integer sequence which is a subsequence of both these sequences, and whose elements are integers in a (strictly) increasing order.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p> The first number is n (1 &#8804; n &#8804; 5000), the length of the first sequence.</p>
<p> The next n integers are elements of the first sequence.</p>
<p> The next is m (1 &#8804; m &#8804; 5000), the length of the second sequence.</p>
<p> The next m integers are elements of the second sequence.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>One number k, the length of the longest possible common subsequence that is increasing, followed by exactly k space-separated integers containing any exemplary sequence of this length.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
